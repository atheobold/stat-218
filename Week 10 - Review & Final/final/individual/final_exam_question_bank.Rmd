## Final Exam Question Bank

### Wild Mushrooms

\noindent \textbf{Q1}[17 points]
Wild mushrooms, such as chanterelles or morels, are delicious, but eating wild
mushrooms carries the risk of accidental poisoning. Even a single bite of the
wrong mushroom can be enough to cause fatal poisoning. An amateur mushroom
hunter is interested in finding an easy rule to differentiate poisonous and
edible mushrooms. They think that the mushroom’s gills (the part which holds and
releases spores) might be related to a mushroom’s edibility. They used a data
set of 8124 mushrooms and their descriptions. For each mushroom, the data set
includes whether it is edible or poisonous and the spacing of the gills (Broad
or Narrow). 

**Please Note**: According to The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American
Mushrooms, there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom;
no rule like "leaflets three, leave them be" for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.

```{r mushroom-data, include = FALSE}
mushrooms <- read_csv(here::here(
  "Week 10 - Review & Final", 
  "final", 
  "individual", 
  "data", 
  "mushrooms.csv")
  ) %>% 
  mutate(class = if_else(class == "e", "Edible", "Poisonous"), 
         `gill-size` = if_else(`gill-size` == "n", "Narrow", "Broad")
         )

```

```{r mushroom-table}

### Mendelian Genetics

\noindent \textbf{Q2} [18 points]

Mendelian inheritance refers to certain patterns of how traits are passed from parents to offspring. These general patterns were established by the Austrian
monk Gregor Mendel, who performed thousands of experiments with pea plants in
the 19th century. Mendel’s discoveries of how traits (such as color and shape)
are passed down from one generation to the next introduced the concept of
dominant and recessive modes of inheritance.

Mendelian inheritance refers to the inheritance of traits controlled by a single
gene with two alleles, one of which may be completely dominant to the other.
You can use a Punnett square to determine the expected ratios of 
possible genotypes in the offspring of two parents. 

In the table below, we see an example of eye color inheritance. In this case, 
both parents are heterozygotes (Aa) for the gene. Half of the gametes produced
by each parent will have the A allele, and half will have the a allele, shown
on the side and the top of the Punnett square. Filling in the cells of the
Punnett square gives the possible genotypes of their children. It also shows the
most likely ratios of the genotypes, which in this case is 25% AA, 50% Aa, and 
25% aa.

![](figures/punnetts.png)

\newpage

\noindent \textbf{(a)} [2 points] When Mendel crossed his pea plants, he learned
that tall (T) was dominant to short (t). Suppose in your Biology course you
carried out an experiment to test if the plot offspring would follow Mendelian
inheritance. 

\noindent Fill in the table defining what the expected tallness inheritance
for your plants should be. 

|                   |         T                 |               t       |
|-------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|
|       T           |                           |               |
|                   |                   |               |
|       t           |                   |               |


\noindent \textbf{(b)} [3 points] If the Mendelian inheritance is true, what
proportions would you expect for each of the following genotypes? Insert the corresponding values in each cell. 

\vspace{0.25cm}

| TT                          | Tt                         | tt               |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|
| $p_{\text{TT}}$ =           | $p_{\text{Tt}}$ =          | $p_{\text{tt}}$ = |
|                             |                            |                  |

\vspace{0.25cm}

\noindent \textbf{(c)} [2 points] Actually, our table could be a bit simpler.
Both the TT and Tt genotypes will present as "tall" plants, whereas tt genotypes
will present as "short" plants.

\noindent Compress your previous table into a new table with only two levels
of tallness. 

| Tall                                 | Short                              |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| $p_{\text{Tall}}$ =                  | $p_{\text{Short}}$ =               |
|                                      |                                    |

\vspace{0.25cm}

\noindent \textbf{(d)} [3 points] If the table above represents what is assumed
to be true about tallness inheritance under $H_0,$ state the alternative
hypothesis using either words or notation. 

\vspace{1in}

\noindent \textbf{(e)} [1 point] After you cross your plants, you measure the
characteristics of the 400 offspring. You note that there are 305 tall pea
plants and 95 short pea plants. 

\noindent Create a table summarizing these observations. 

\newpage

\noindent \textbf{(f)} [4 points] Calculate how far "off" was your observed
number of tall and short plants were from what you expected if $H_0$ was true.
Use these values to report the $X^2$ statistic for your experiment. 

__Tall__:

\vspace{0.5in}

__Short:__

\vspace{0.5in}

__$X^2$ statistic__:

\vspace{0.25in}

\noindent \textbf{(g)} [3 points] The p-value associated with your $X^2$
statistic is `r pchisq(0.3319, df = 1, lower.tail = FALSE)`. Your Biology
textbook suggests you interpret this value as:

> *The large p-value proves that Mendelian inheritance is true.*

\noindent What issue(s) to you have with this interpretation?

\vspace{1in}

### Seasonal Colds

\noindent \textbf{Q3} [22 points]
A local doctor suspects that there is a seasonal trend in the occurrence of the
common cold. She estimates that 40% of the cases each year occur in the winter,
40% in the spring, 10% in the summer and 10% in the fall. A random sample of
1000 patient cases was collected, and the number of cold cases for each season
was recorded. 

A summary table is included below:

```{r colds-data}
colds <- tibble(Season = 
                  c(
                    rep("Winter", 374), 
                    rep("Spring", 292), 
                    rep("Summer", 169), 
                    rep("Fall", 165)
                  )
                )
```

```{r colds-table}
colds %>% 
  count(Season) %>% 
  rename(`Number of Patients` = n) %>% 
  pander()
```

\noindent \textbf{(a)} [4 points] If the doctor's suspicion was correct, what
proportions would you expect for each cell? Insert the corresponding values in
each cell. 

\vspace{0.25cm}

| Fall                | Spring             | Summer             | Winter             | 
|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| $p_{\text{fall}}$ =  | $p_{\text{spring}}$ = | $p_{\text{summer}}$ = | $p_{\text{winter}}$ =  |
|                     |                    |                    |                    |

\vspace{0.25cm}

\noindent \textbf{(b)} [3 points] If the table above represents what is assumed
to be true under $H_0,$ state the alternative hypothesis using either words or
notation. 

\vspace{1in}

\noindent \textbf{(c)} [4 points] Compute the table of expected counts.  

| Fall                | Spring             | Summer             | Winter             | 
|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
|                     |                    |                    |                    |
|                     |                    |                    |                    |

\vspace{1in}

\noindent \textbf{(d)} [2 points] What is the summer cold cell's contribution to
the $X^2$ statistic? 

\vspace{1in}

\noindent \textbf{(e)} [2 points] Evaluate whether the conditions required to
use the $\chi^2$ distribution to obtain a p-value are violated. 

\vspace{1in}

\noindent \textbf{(f)} [3 points] An $X^2$ statistic of 124 was obtained for
these data. Fill in the `R` code below to find the p-value for this statistic.
*Hint:* The `lower.tail` input takes one of two options `TRUE` or `FALSE`. 

```{r code-fill-in-chisq, eval = FALSE, echo= TRUE}
pchisq(_____________, df = ______________, lower.tail = ___________)
```

\newpage

\noindent \textbf{(g)} [4 points] Using the code you input above, a p-value less
than 0.000000123 was obtained. Based on this p-value what would you conclude
about the Doctor's hypothesis regarding the distribution of colds throughout the
year?

### Professor Attractiveness

\noindent \textbf{Q4} [21 points]
Data were scraped from _ratemyprofessors.com_, a website which allows college
and university students to assign ratings to professors and campuses of
American, Canadian, and United Kingdom institutions. In order for the rating to
be posted, a rater must rate the professor in the following categories: 
`overall quality`, `level of difficulty`, and their `hotness`.  

The Dean of the College of Science and Math would like to know if the difficulty
rating of female professor's at Cal Poly is related to how attractive they are
perceived to be. 

A table of observed counts in shown below.  

```{r, professor-table, echo = FALSE}
professors <- tibble(attractiveness = 
                       c(rep("Attractive", 172), 
                         rep("Unattractive", 314)

### Guilty Decisions

\noindent
\textbf{Q5}[11 points] 
The effect of guilt on how a decision maker focuses on a problem was
investigated in the *Journal of Behavioral Decision Making* (January 2007). A
total of 155 volunteer students participated in the study, where each was
randomly assigned to one of three emotional states (guilt, anger, or neutral)
through a reading / writing task. Immediately after the task, the students were
presented with a decision problem (e.g., whether or not to spend money on
repairing a very old car). The researchers found that a higher proportion of
students in the guilty-state group chose not to repair the car than those in the neutral-state and anger-state groups.

\vspace{0.25in}

\noindent
\textbf{(a)}[3 pts] What is the study design? Explain your reasoning. Select
one.

\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] Observational study. The researchers did not take a random sample of
students.
\item[(ii)] Observational study. There is no random assignment of students to 
emotional state.
\item[(iii)] Experiment. The students are a representative sample of all
students.
\item[(iv)] Experiment. The students were randomly assigned to emotional state.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.25cm}

\noindent \textbf{(b)}[3 pts] Which types of sampling bias may be present in
this study? Select all that are present, or if you believe there is no bias 
present, select option 4) No bias.

\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] Selection bias
\item[(ii)] Non-response bias
\item[(iii)] Response bias
\item[(iv)] No bias
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.25cm}

\noindent \textbf{(c)}[3 pts] The researchers found a difference in the 
proportion of students in the guilty-state group chose not to repair the car
than those in the neutral-state and anger-state groups. Can we conclude that the emotional state group caused a higher proportion of students to not repair the
car? Select one.

\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] Yes, because these data are from a representative sample.
\item[(ii)] No, because the students are volunteers.
\item[(iii)] Yes, because the researchers evened out confounding variables
across emotional state group.
\item[(iv)] No, because the sample size is not large enough.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.25cm}

\noindent \textbf{(d)} [2 pts] Which type of plot would be the **most**
appropriate to display the relationship between each level of emotional state
and whether students choose to repair the car? Select all that apply.

\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] Scatterplot
\item[(ii)] Filled bar plot
\item[(iii)] Pie chart
\item[(iv)] Side-by-side boxplot
\end{itemize}


### Distribution of Fish on Blackfoot River

\noindent \textbf{Q6} [19 points]
Montana Fish, Wildlife, & Parks personnel have collected data on fish caught on
the Blackfoot River (outside Helena, Montana) for the last 25 years. To capture
the fish, fisheries biologists use electrofishing equipment to attract the fish
to the boat, then dip them out of the water with nets. Each fish's length (in 
cm) and weight (in grams) is then measured. Once the measurements are taken, 
the fish is tossed back into the river. Biologists are often working in cold
conditions in late autumn or early spring, so some measurement error and missing
data are expected. 

```{r fish-data}

fish <- read_csv(here::here(
  "Week 10 - Review & Final", 
  "final", 
  "individual", 
  "data", 
  "BlackfootFish.csv")
  ) %>% 
  drop_na(section, species) %>% 
  mutate(species = case_when(species == "Brown" ~ "Brown Trout", 
                             species == "Bull" ~ "Bull Trout", 
                             species == "RBT" ~ "Rainbow Trout", 
                             species == "WCT" ~ "Whitefish")
         ) %>% 
  filter(year > 1998) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.factor(year))

```

These data are not from a random sample. The goal is to catch all fish within a
section of the Blackfoot River every few years to assess the health of the
population. Montana Fish, Wildlife, & Parks is interested in analyzing if the
prevalence of the different species of fish has stayed relative stable over 
the years. The dataset consists of `r nrow(fish)` observations, recorded over 
`r distinct(fish, year) %>% nrow()` years. 

```{r fish-preview}
fish %>% 
  select(length, weight, year, section, species) 
```

\noindent \textbf{(a)} [2 points] Based on the output above, what is the
observational unit for this study?

\vspace{0.5in}

\noindent \textbf{(b)} [3 points] Based on the output above, what type of 
variable is `year`? Given the stated analysis, is this the correct data type for
this variable?

\vspace{1in}

\newpage

\noindent \textbf{(c)} [3 points] Based on the bar plot below, describe the
relationship between the sampling year and the species of captured fish. Make
direct reference to characteristics of the plot!

They used computer simulation to obtain the null distribution of the $X^2$ 
statistic shown on the next page. 

Fill in the steps necessary to obtain out **one** statistic on the null

## General Concepts

\noindent \textbf{Q7}[2 points] Suppose you reject the null hypothesis at the
0.05 level of significance. A colleague had planned to use a 0.01 level of
significance instead. Will your colleague also reject the null hypothesis?

\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Yes
\item[(b)] No
\item[(c)] Maybe
\item[(d)] Changing a level of significance cannot affect decisions.
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\noindent \textbf{Q8}[2 points] In hypothesis testing,

\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] a type II error occurs when you fail to reject a false null
hypothesis.
\item[(b)] you do not need to decide on a level of significance before you find
a p-value; you can adjust based on the p-value you observe.
\item[(c)] one of the main sources of type I errors is that the sample size was
not large enough.
\item[(d)] p-values are the probability that the null hypothesis is false.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Q9} For each of the following, select the single most appropriate analysis for the situation described. You may use an analysis for
more than one situation. (2 pts each)

\item[(a)] Researchers are interested in investigating how
the number of visitors to Yellowstone National Park in a year impacts the local
economy in Livingston. To do this they count the number of yearly visitors to
Yellowstone and measure the dollars spent by tourists in Livingston for the
year.

\item[(b)] A study of honeybees looked at whether the
proportions of different honeybee species varies by state. Ten states were used 
in the study, and 100 honeybees were randomly sampled in each state, and 7
different species were seen in the data set.

\item[(e)] You are interested in deciding if you should rent
a new apartment off campus. As this will be your first time living off campus,
you are anxious to  know the average amount of time it should take you to walk
to campus. You, a logical person, know that someone's height drastically affects
how long it takes them to walk places. What is the best {\bf method} to answer
his research question? Circle one.
