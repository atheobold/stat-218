\textbf{Q1}[8 points] Researchers in Southern England collected data on
grassland butterflies. They
were interested in whether movement patterns varied across species and between
male and female butterflies. Researchers observed 164 butterflies over the
three-year length of this study, of which 28 were female and 136 were male. 
These 164 butterflies were considered to be representative of all grassland
butterflies. The butterfly movements were observed by measuring how far they
flew (in meters) from one landing site to the next, called step distance. This
was done by placing a flag at each landing site and measuring the distance
between the flags using a mapping software.

The researchers were interested in investigating if there was a difference
between how far male and female butterflies travel, on average, between landing
sites.

\textbf{(c)} [2 pts] Assuming a statistical difference in step distance is
found between the male and female butterflies in the sample, what is the scope
of inference for this study? Select one. 

\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] Sex causes a difference in average step distance for all grassland
butterflies. \\
\item[(ii)] Sex is associated with a difference in average step distance for
the sample of grassland butterflies. \\

of grassland butterflies. \\
\item[(iv)] Sex is associated with a difference in average step distance for all
grassland butterflies.

\textbf{Q4}[21 points] As you may be aware, many individuals are concerned about
the presence of BPA in plastics, especially plastics that make contact with food
and drinks. Currently, these is an incomplete understanding of how exposure to
BPA affects our ingestion. Last year Dr. Hagobian in the Kinesiology and Public
Health Department carried out a study to investigate the role of Bisphenol A
(BPA) in metabolism and endocrine disruption. 

Dr. Hahobian recruited 11 subjects, each of whom ate two types of cookies on two
separate visits, one visit in December and the second in February. On one visit
they ate the BPA-laced cookie and, on a different day, a placebo cookie (with no
BPA). Thirty minutes after eating the cookie on each occasion, they were given a
glucose tolerance test to measure their glucose metabolism. 

A summary of the glucose test results (mmol/L) after eating each type of cookie
as well as the difference in glucose results for each subject is shown below.

| Cookie                    | Mean   | Standard Deviation | n  |
|---------------------------|:------:|:-----------------:|:---:|
| Placebo                   |	5.259  | 0.762              | 11 |
| BPA	                      | 5.355	 | 1.462              |	11 |
| Difference: Placebo - BPA | -0.095 | 1.153              | 11 |

\newpage

\noindent
\textbf{(a)}[4 points] For simplicity, Dr. Hagobian could have given all
subjects the BPA cookie on their first visit in December, and the Placebo cookie
on the second visit in February, but he didn’t. Instead, when a subject came for
their first visit, he flipped a coin. If it was heads, they received BPA on that
visit (and Placebo on their second visit). If it was tails they received the 
Placebo cookie first. Why did he add this extra coin flipping step instead of
the simpler approach of just giving everyone one type of cookie in December and
the other type in February?

\vspace{1in}

\noindent
\textbf{(b)}[2 points] Dr. Hagobian is interested in testing whether BPA causes
a shift in glucose levels. Which analysis would be more appropriate? Circle one.

obtain a p-value? Circle all that apply.

\item[(vi)] Linear relationship between the variables \\
\item[(vii)] Normality of the differences \\
\item[(viii)] Normality of the observations within each group \\

\newpage

\noindent
\textbf{(e)}[3 points] Using `R`, Dr. Hagobian obtained the following table. 

```{r dr-hagobian-results}
dr_hagobian <- tibble(Difference = 
                        rnorm(n = 11, mean = -0.095, sd = 1.153)

Which of the following would be the best overall conclusion in the context of 
Dr. Hagobian's study? Your selection should reflect the hypotheses you wrote in
part (c)!

\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] With such a large p-value, we have significant evidence to reject the
null hypothesis. We conclude the true mean of the differences in glucose 
between eating a BPA cracker and a Placebo cracker is not 0. 

\item[(ii)] With such a large p-value, we have insufficient evidence to reject
the null hypothesis. We conclude the true mean of the differences in glucose 
between eating a BPA cracker and a Placebo cracker is 0. 

\item[(iii)] With such a large p-value, we have insufficient evidence to reject
the null hypothesis. We do not have evidence to suggest the mean of the
differences in glucose between eating a BPA cracker and a Placebo cracker is
different from 0. 

\item[(vi)] With such a large p-value, we have significant evidence to reject
the null hypothesis. We conclude the true mean glucose after eating a BPA
cracker is different from the true mean glucose after eating a Placebo cracker.

\item[(v)] With such a large p-value, we have insufficient evidence to reject
the null hypothesis. We conclude there is no difference in the true mean glucose
after eating a BPA cracker and the true mean glucose after eating a Placebo
cracker.

\item[(vi)] With such a large p-value, we have insufficient evidence to reject 
the null hypothesis. We do not have evidence to suggest the true mean glucose
after eating a BPA cracker is different from the true mean glucose after eating
a Placebo cracker.

\textbf{(h)}[2 points] In a different study, Dr. Hagobian obtained a p-value of
0.0425 and a 95% confidence interval of (-1.129, 0.0437). Which of the 
following statements about these findings is true? Circle one.  

\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] The results of the hypothesis test and the confidence interval tend
to agree with each other at the 5\% significance level. Four percent of the time
we would obtain a statistic like the one we saw somewhere in the interval of 
-1.129 mmol/L to 0.0437 mmol/L. 

\item[(ii)] The results of the hypothesis test and the confidence interval are
conflicting at the 5\% significance level. With a p-value of 0.0425 we have 
evidence to reject the null hypothesis, which would mean that our confidence 
interval would not contain 0.

\item[(iii)] The results of the hypothesis test and the confidence interval are 
conflicting at the 5\% significance level. There's a 95% chance that a statistic
of 0.0425 would be in the interval (-1.129, 0.0437). 

\item[(vi)] The results of the hypothesis test and the confidence interval seem
to agree with one another at the 5\% significance level. With a p-value of
0.0425 we do not have evidence to reject the null hypothesis, thus indicating
that 0 should be in our interval.

<!-- Questions 1-9 -->

\noindent \textbf{Q2} [18  points]

Mendelian inheritance refers to certain patterns of how traits are passed from 
parents to offspring. These general patterns were established by the Austrian
monk Gregor Mendel, who performed thousands of experiments with pea plants in
the 19th century. Mendel’s discoveries of how traits (such as color and shape)
are passed down from one generation to the next introduced the concept of
dominant and recessive modes of inheritance.

Mendelian inheritance refers to the inheritance of traits controlled by a single
gene with two alleles, one of which may be completely dominant to the other.
You can use a Punnett square to determine the expected ratios of 
possible genotypes in the offspring of two parents. 

In the Punnett square below, we see an example of eye color inheritance. In this
case, both parents are heterozygotes (Aa) for the gene. Half of the gametes
produced by each parent will have the A allele, and half will have the a allele,
displayed on the side and the top of the Punnett square. Filling in the cells of
the Punnett square gives the possible genotypes of their children. It also shows
the most likely ratios of the genotypes, which in this case is 25% AA, 50% Aa,
and 25% aa.

```{r, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/punnetts.png")
```

\newpage

\noindent \textbf{(a)} [2 points] When Mendel crossed his pea plants, he learned
that tall (T) was dominant to short (t). Suppose in your Biology course you
carried out an experiment to test if the plant offspring would follow Mendelian
inheritance. 

\noindent Fill in the table defining what the expected tallness inheritance
for your plants should be. 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
    &  T            &  t            \\
\hline
T   &  \hspace{1in} &  \hspace{1in} \\
    &               &               \\
\hline
t  &  \hspace{1in} &  \hspace{1in}  \\
    &               &               \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent \textbf{(b)} [3 points] If the Mendelian inheritance is true, what
__proportions__ would you expect for each of the following genotypes? Insert the
corresponding values in each cell. 

\vspace{0.25cm}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
  TT    &  Tt   & tt    \\
\hline
$p_{\text{TT}}$ =  \hspace{1in}    & $p_{\text{Tt}}$ = \hspace{1in}   & $p_{\text{tt}}$ = \hspace{1in} \\
    &               &               \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\vspace{0.25cm}

\noindent \textbf{(c)} [2 points] Actually, our table could be a bit simpler.
Both the TT and Tt genotypes will present as "tall" plants, whereas tt genotypes
will present as "short" plants.

\noindent Compress your previous table into a new table with only two levels
of tallness. 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c}
  Tall   &  Short   \\
\hline
$p_{\text{Tall}}$ =  \hspace{1in}    & $p_{\text{Short}}$ = \hspace{1in} \\

\noindent \textbf{(b)} [3 points] If the table above represents what is
assumed to be true about tallness inheritance __if the null hypothesis is
true__, state the alternative hypothesis using either words or notation.

\noindent \textbf{(c)} [1 point] After you cross your plants, you measure the
characteristics of the 400 offspring. You note that there are 305 tall pea
plants and 95 short pea plants. 

\noindent Create a table summarizing these observations. 

\newpage

\noindent \textbf{(d)} [4 points] Calculate how far "off" your observed
number of tall and short plants were from what you would have expected to see
if $H_0$ was true. Use these values to report the $X^2$ statistic for your
experiment. 

__Tall__:

\noindent \textbf{(e)} [3 points] The p-value associated with your $X^2$
statistic is `r pchisq(0.3319, df = 1, lower.tail = FALSE)`. Your Biology
textbook suggests you interpret this value as:

> *The large p-value proves that Mendelian inheritance is true.*

\noindent What issue(s) to you have with this interpretation?

\noindent \textbf{Q6} [19 points]
Montana Fish, Wildlife, & Parks personnel have collected data on fish caught on
the Blackfoot River (outside Helena, Montana) for the last 25 years. To capture
the fish, fisheries biologists use electrofishing equipment to attract the fish
to the boat, then dip them out of the water with nets. Each fish's length (in 
cm) and weight (in grams) is then measured. Once the measurements are taken, 
the fish is tossed back into the river. 

```{r fish-data}

fish <- read_csv(here::here(
  "Week 10 - Review & Final", 
  "final", 
  "individual", 
  "data", 
  "BlackfootFish.csv")
  ) %>% 
  drop_na(section, species) %>% 
  mutate(species = case_when(species == "Brown" ~ "Brown Trout", 
                             species == "Bull" ~ "Bull Trout", 
                             species == "RBT" ~ "Rainbow Trout", 
                             species == "WCT" ~ "Whitefish")
         ) %>% 
  filter(year > 1998) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.factor(year))

```

The dataset consists of `r nrow(fish)` observations, recorded over 
`r distinct(fish, year) %>% nrow()` years. 

\newpage



```{r fish-preview}
fish %>% 
  select(length, weight, year, section, species)

\noindent \textbf{(a)} [2 points] Based on the output above, what is the
observational __unit__ for this study?

\vspace{0.5in}

\noindent \textbf{(b)} [3 points] Based on the output above, what type of 
variable is `year`? Given the stated analysis, is this the correct data type for
this variable?

\vspace{1in}

\noindent \textbf{(c)} [3 points] Based on the bar plot below, describe the
relationship between the sampling year and the species of captured fish. Make
direct reference to characteristics of the plot! 

```{r fish-table, include = FALSE}
fish %>% 
  group_by(year, species) %>%

  pivot_wider(names_from = year, 
              values_from = n) %>% 
  adorn_totals(where = c("row", "col")) %>% 
  pander()
```

```{r fish-plot, fig.align = "left"}
fish %>%  
  ggplot(
    mapping = aes(y = year, fill = species)
       ) +

\noindent \textbf{(d)} [5 points] The statistician at Montana Fish, Wildlife, &
Parks prefers using simulation-based methods rather than theory-based methods.
They used computer simulation to obtain the null distribution of the $X^2$
statistic shown below. 

Fill in the steps necessary to obtain out **one** statistic on the null 
distribution.
