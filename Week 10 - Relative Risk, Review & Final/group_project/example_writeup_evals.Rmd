## Data Description

The data for this project come from end of semester student evaluations for a
large sample of professors from The University of Texas at Austin. The original
data set published in *Beauty in the Classroom* (Hamermesh & Parker, 2005) are
available through the **openintro** `R` package. 

For the Midterm Project, my analysis focused on the relationship between 
professor's attractiveness and course evalution scores, two numerical variables.
For this analysis, however, I will be focusing on categorical variables: 
professor's self-identified sex (M / F) and a professor's teaching rank 
(teaching / tenure track / tenured). Specifically, I am interested in
investigating if there are larger proportions of male-identifying faculty in 
tenure track and tenured positions, whereas there are larger proportions of 
women in teaching positions. 


## Data Visualization & Summarization
<!-- In this section you create three visualizations of your data -->

### Investigating Professor's Self-Identified Sex

```{r bar-plot-1}
evals_ind %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = gender)
         ) +
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(x = "Professor's Self-Identified Sex", 
       y = "Number of Professors")

evals_ind %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  count()
```

In the bar plot of professor's sex, we see that there are more male identifying
professors than female identifying professors. Based on the summary table, we 
see there are 14 more male faculty than female faculty. 

### Investigating Professor's Teaching Rank

```{r bar-plot-1}
evals_ind %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = rank)
         ) +
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(x = "Professor's Teaching Rank", 
       y = "Number of Professors")

evals_ind %>% 
  group_by(rank) %>% 
  count()
```

In the bar plot of professor's teaching rank, we see the majority of faculty 
are tenured, nearly double the number of tenure track faculty at UT Austin. The
smallest group is teaching faculty, with only 15 professors.

### Investigating the Relationship between Professor's Self-Identified Sex and Teaching Rank

```{r bar-plot-1}
evals_ind %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = rank, fill = gender)
         ) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") + 
  labs(x = "Professor's Teaching Rank", 
       y = "Number of Professors", 
       fill = "Professor's Gender")

evals_ind %>% 
  group_by(gender, rank) %>% 
  count()
```



## Independence of 

### Model Conditions

There are four conditions required to be verified before we perform inference
on the linear relationship between these two variables. These conditions are:
linearity of the relationship, independence of observations, nearly normal
residuals, and constant variability. 

__Linearity:__ As seen in the scatterplot above, the relationship between 
average course evaluation score and average beauty score is weakly linear. 
Although the relationship is not very strong, it does not appear that there is
evidence of a non-linear (e.g., quadratic, logarithmic) relationship.

__Independence:__ These data were from a convenience sample of professors at 
the University of Texas at Austin. The researchers obtained the course
evaluation scores for every professor in the sample, for every course they 
taught. Thus, for some professors there were multiple observations. 

Having multiple observations for each professor violates the independence
condition. Thus, for each professor I randomly selected **one** of their
courses. After removing these repeated observations, I no longer believe the
independence condition is violated. There is no reason to believe that knowing 
the evaluation score of one professor should give me perfect information about 
another professor's evaluation score. 

__Normality of Residuals:__ The condition of normality can be checked using 
either the distribution of the responses (average evaluation scores) or the 
distribution of residuals from the regression model. Based on the histogram 
above, it does not appear that the condition of nearly normal responses is 
violated. While the distribution has a slight left skew, the sample size is 94
professors, well over the threshold of 60 for substantially skewed
distributions.

__Equal Variance:__ The variability of the evaluation scores appears similar 
across the regression line. While there is a larger spread in the evaluation 
scores for professors with beauty ratings between 4 and 5, the size of these
differences is not large. Instead, across all beauty ratings, it appears that 
course evaluation scores vary from about 3 to about 5. 

Since I have not seen any major violations of these conditions, I believe using 
t-based methods will not incorrectly estimate a p-value or confidence interval. 

### Coefficient Estimates

```{r coefficients}

eval_lm <- lm(score ~ bty_avg, data = evals_ind)

## Code to get coefficient table from linear regression
get_regression_table(eval_lm, conf.level = 0.90) %>% 
  kable()
```

From the output above, we can see that the estimated intercept for the
regression line is 3.594 and the estimated slope is 0.084. The y-intercept of 
3.594 represents the predicted mean evaluation score for a professor who 
received an average beauty score of zero. The lowest average beauty score
observed in these data was two, so I believe this would be considered
extrapolation. 

The regression line suggests that for every increase of one in average beauty 
score, we expect the mean course evaluation score to increase by about 0.084.
Course evaluation scores are on a scale of 0 to 5, so an increase of 0.084 is
quite small. 

### Inference for the Slope

<!-- Here is where you describe the decision for the hypothesis test for whether the slope is 0.  -->

Although the size of the slope coefficient is small (0.086), at a 0.05 
significance level I conclude that the relationship between average beauty 
score and average evaluation score is "significantly" different from
0 (t-stat = 2.356, p-value = 0.021). 

The 95% confidence interval is (0.025, 0.147), which implies that I am 95%
confident that for an increase of one in average beauty score I should expect an
increase between 0.025 and 0.147 in the average course evaluation score.
