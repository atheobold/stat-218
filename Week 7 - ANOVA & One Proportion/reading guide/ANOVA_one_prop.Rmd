# Exploring Categorical and Quantitative Data

## Week 3 Reading Guide: Introduction to `R`, Categorical Variables, and a Single Quantitative Variable

### Section 1.7 (Data in `R`) {-}

* Starting_with_R

\setstretch{1.25}

#### Notes {-}

`R` is case sensitive, meaning it reads `data` differently from `Data`.  If you get an error message, check that your capitalization is correct.

`R` does not like spaces or special characters  This means the column and row headers in the data set should not have spaces, periods, commas, etc.  Instead of titling the variable `column header`, use `column_header` or `ColumnHeader`.

**Tidy data**:  Data frames with

\rgi 1 row per ________________, 

\rgi 1 column per ____________.

We highly recommend completing Tutorial 1 at the end of Chapter 1 (all four lessons) to give you practice with R/RStudio AND to help reflect on the content of Chapter 1: basics of data, sampling, study design, and scope of inference.  These tutorials have some content questions and some places for you to practice using R online with some guidance.

\rgi __ indicate spots you need to type in functions, data sets, or variable names.

\rgi There are Hint and Solution buttons on the R code box to help you.

We would not expect you to know the coding right now, especially for things like mutations or creating new variables in the data set.  But seeing some initial coding for these more difficult functions will only make you more comfortable using the functions needed for this course!
	
#### Functions {-}

State what these introductory functions do in `R`:

`glimpse(data_set_name)`

`head(data_set_name)`

`data_set_name$variable_name`

`%>%`

`<-`

What is the difference between a standardized segmented bar plot and a mosaic plot?
\rgs

True or false: Pie charts are generally highly recommended ways to graphically display categorical data.

True or false: Two categorical variables are associated if the conditional proportions of a particular outcome (typically of the response variable) differ across levels of the other variable (typically the explanatory variable).

True or false: When a segmented bar plot has segments that sum to 1 (or 100%), the segment heights correspond to the proportions conditioned on the **segment**.

### Section 2.4 (`R`: Exploratory data analysis) and Section 2.5 (Chapter 2 review) {-}

Section 2.4 presents four tutorials on analyzing quantitative data in `R`.  We recommend you complete all four.

Parameters summarize _____________.

Fill in the following table with the appropriate notation for each summary measure.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{2in}|p{2in}|}\hline
