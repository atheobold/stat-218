### `R` coding {-}

##### Calculating normal probabilities {-}

When using the `pnorm()` `R` function, you will need to enter values for the arguments `mean`, `sd`, and `q` to match the question.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
pnorm(mean = mu, sd = sigma, q = x, lower.tail = TRUE)
```

This function will return the proportion of the N(`mu`,`sigma`) distribution which is *below* the value `x`.

Example: `pnorm(mean = 5, sd = 2, q = 3, lower.tail = TRUE)` will give us the proportion of a N(5,2) distribution which is below 3, which equals 0.159:
 
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
pnorm(mean = 5, sd = 2, q = 3, lower.tail = TRUE)
```

Changing to `lower.tail = FALSE` will give the proportion of the distribution which is *above* the value `x`.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
pnorm(mean = 5, sd = 2, q = 3, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

##### Displaying normal probabilities {-} 

When using the `normTail()` `R` function, you will need to enter values for the arguments `m`, `s`, and `L` (or `U`) to match the question.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
normTail(m = mu, s = sigma, L = x)
```

This function (in the `openintro` package) will plot a N(`mu`, `sigma`) distribution and shade the area that is below the value `x`.

Example: `normTail(m = 5, s = 2, L = 3)` creates the plot pictured below.

```{r normgt3, fig.cap="", out.width="60%", echo=FALSE}
#include_graphics("images/Norm_greaterthan_3.png")
normTail(m = 5, s = 2, L = 3)
```

Changing `L` to `U` will shade the area *above* `x`.  

Example: `normTail(m = 5, s = 2, U = 3)` plots a N(5,2) distribution with the area above 3 shaded.

##### Calculating normal percentiles {-}

When using the `qnorm()` `R` function, you will need to enter values for the arguments `mean`, `sd`, and `p` to match the question.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
qnorm(mean = mu, sd = sigma, p = x, lower.tail = TRUE)
```

This function will return the value on the N(`mu`, `sigma`) distribution which has `x` area of the distribution *below* it.

Example:  `qnorm(mean = 5, sd = 2, p = 0.159, lower.tail = TRUE)` will give us the value on a N(5,2) distribution which has 0.159 (15.9%) of the distribution below it, which equals 3 (from the `R` output above).

Changing to `lower.tail = FALSE` will give the value which has `x` area of the distribution *above* it.

We would recommend you work through each of the examples in Section 5.2.4 using `R`.

#### Vocabulary {-}

#### Reminders from previous sections {-}

$n$ = sample size

$\hat{p}$ = sample proportion

$\pi$ = population proportion

General steps of a hypothesis test:

1. Frame the research question in terms of hypotheses.

2. Collect and summarize data using a test statistic.
	
3. Assume the null hypothesis is true, and simulate or mathematically model a null distribution for the test statistic.

4. Compare the observed test statistic to the null distribution to calculate a p-value.

5. Make a conclusion based on the p-value and write the conclusion in context.

Parameter: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a population.

Statistic: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a sample.

Sampling distribution: plot of statistics from 1000s of samples of the same size taken from the same population.

Standard deviation of a statistic: the variability of statistics from 1000s of samples; how far, on average, each statistic is from the true value of the parameter.

Standard error of a statistic: estimated standard deviation of a statistic.

Hypothesis test: a process to determine how strong the evidence of an effect is.
		
\rgi Also called a ‘significance test’.

Theory-based method: Develop a mathematical model for the sampling distribution of the statistic under the null hypothesis and use the model to calculate the probability of the observed sample statistic (or one more extreme) occurring.

Null hypothesis ($H_0$): the skeptical perspective; no difference; no change; no effect; random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is **wrong**.

Alternative hypothesis ($H_A$): the new perspective; a difference/increase/decrease; an effect; not random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is **correct**.

P-value: probability of seeing the observed sample data, or something more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

$\implies$ Lower the p-value the stronger the evidence AGAINST the null hypothesis and FOR the alternative hypothesis.

Decision: a determination of whether to 'reject' or 'fail to reject' a null hypothesis based on a p-value and a pre-set level of significance.

Significance level ($\alpha$): a threshold used to determine if a p-value provides enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not.

\rgi Common levels of $\alpha$ include 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10.

Statistically significant: results are considered statistically significant if the p-value is below the significance level.

Central Limit Theorem: For large sample sizes, the sampling distribution of a sample proportion (or mean) will be approximately normal (bell-shaped and symmetric).

Confidence interval: a process to determine how large an effect is; a range of plausible values for the parameter; also called 'estimation'.

Margin of error: the value that is added to and subtracted from the sample statistic to create a confidence interval; half the width of a confidence interval.

How can we determine the value of $z^⋆$ to use as the multiplier in a confidence interval?
\rgs

\rgi In `R`, use `qnorm(mean = __, sd = __, p = __)`.

Select one answer in each set of parentheses: The higher the confidence level, the (larger/smaller) the multiplier, meaning the confidence interval will be (wider/narrower).

If the success-failure condition for the Central Limit Theorem is not met, what is the appropriate method of analysis?  Select one:
\rgi A. Theory-based approach
