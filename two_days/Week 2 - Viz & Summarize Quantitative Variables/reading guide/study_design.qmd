## Chapter 2: Sampling & Experimental Design

Statistic:

</br>

Parameter:

</br>

### Section 2.1.1: Populations & Samples

(Target) Population:

</br>

Census:

</br>

Sample:

</br>

### Section 2.1.2: Parameters & Statistics

Statistic:

</br>

Parameter:

</br>

### Section 2.1.3: Anecdotal Evidence

Anecdotal evidence

</br>

### Section 2.1.4: Sampling from a Population

Bias:

</br>

Simple Random Sample:

</br>

Representative:

</br>

Non-response bias:

</br>

Response bias:

</br>

Convenience sample:

</br>

#### Notes

* Someone must first be _chosen_ to be in a study and refuse to participate in
order to have **non-response bias**.

* There must be a valid reason for someone to lie or be untruthful to justify
saying **response bias** is present.  Yes, anyone could lie at any time to any
question.  Response bias is when those lies are predictable and systematic based
on outside influences.

</br>

True or False: Convenience sampling tends to result in non-response bias.

</br>

True or False: Volunteer sampling tends to result in response bias.

</br>

### Section 2.1.5: Four Sampling Methods

Simple Random Sampling:

</br>

Stratified Sampling:

</br>

Strata:

</br>

Cluster Sample:

</br>

Clusters:

</br>

Multistage Sample:

</br>

#### Notes 

Ideally, how should we sample cases from our target population? Using what
sampling method? 

</br>

True or False: Random sampling helps to resolve selection bias, but has no 
impact on non-response or response bias.

</br>

True or False: Observational studies can show an association between two
variables, but cannot determine a causal relationship.

</br>

True or False: In order for an experiment to be valid, a placebo must be used.

</br>

True or False: If random sampling of the target population is used, and no other
types of bias are suspected, results from the sample can be generalized to the
entire target population.

</br>

True or False: If random sampling of the target population is used, and no other
types of bias are suspected, results from the sample can be inferred as a causal
relationship between the explanatory and response variables.
