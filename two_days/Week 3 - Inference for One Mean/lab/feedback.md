# Question 4

## Axis Label 

Should be *Hours Worked* for Americans

### If they say "average"

Careful! We are plotting the raw data, not statistics about the data. This histogram plots the hours worked for every person in the sample. 

### If they don't say Americans

What population were these observations collected from? All people? From a specific country?

### If they say "hours"

Your axis label should make it clear what the variable being plotted is. What are the hours measured on? 

## Binwidth

If they chose a binwidth less than 5, then say:

When selecting a binwidth, we want for our histogram to appear as smooth / continuous as possible. This small of a binwidth results in a very spiked / jagged plot. I would recommend choosing a larger binwidth for a smoother plot!
