# Question 10

## If they say "90% chance"

Careful! The true mean is either in our interval or not, but we don't know. So, 
we can't say we are 90% sure it is in there. It's either 0% or 100%. We can't 
estimate the chance that the parameter is in the interval. Instead, we are 
confident that if we make lots of intervals 90% of them should contain the
population mean. 

## If they say "90% of the people"

Our confidence interval is for the population mean, not the number of people! 
We are 90% confident the population mean hours worked per week for all 
working Americans is contained in our interval. 

## If they reference the sample mean instead of the population mean

Careful! Our confidence interval is for the population mean, not the sample
mean! We use our sample mean as the center of our confidence interval, so there
is a 100% chance that it is capture in the interval! We don't, however, know if 
our interval contains the true population mean. 

## If their interpretation doesn't contain context

"Which group of people are we interested in?"

"Is our interval for the number of hours worked in a day? A week? A year?"

# Question 11

## If they don't reject the null

When making a hypothesis test decision with a confidence interval, we look 
for the null value in the interval. Is 40 contained in your 90% confidence 
interval?

## If they talk about the interval being close to 40

The 90% interval already captured the uncertainty for the sample mean, so now
we need to see whether the null value overlaps with the interval. When making 
a decision, we're not looking at how close or far 40 is from the interval. 

# Question 12

## If they say "low probability of getting the null"

The p-value isn't the probability of getting the null, it 
is the probability of obtaining the results we saw or something
more extreme **is the null was true.**

## If they use 0.05 instead of 0.1

Careful! Our significance level coincides with the confidence level we used.
What percent confidence level did we use in the last problem? What significance
level should you use?

## General reminder about p-value interpretation

The p-value represents the probability of obtaining the results we did (sample
mean) or something more extreme, if the null was true. Given the p-value we 
obtained is 3.76%, is it likely for us to have obtained a sample mean as large
as what we saw due to chance alone?

## General reminder about making a decision

Remember when making a hypothesis test decision, we either reject the null or 
fail to reject the null!
