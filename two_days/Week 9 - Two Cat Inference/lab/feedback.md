# Question 4

__If they only say there is a relationship between getting the vaccine and developing malaria__

You are on the right track, it DOES look like there is a relationship, but it would be great to include more information about WHY it looks that way. Which group(s) look different versus similar?

__If there is no description:__

Careful! You were asked to provide a description of what you see in the filled bar plot. Does it appear that there is a relationship between getting the vaccine and developing malaria? Why or why not?

# Question 11

__If they say the observations are independent but say why:__

You need to justify WHY you believe the observations are or are not independent! Think back to #1, what is the observational unit for this study? Does knowing the outcome (developing malaria) for one child give you perfect information about the outcome / response for another child? 

__If they say the children are independent:__

I would agree that one child getting malaria does not 100% guarantee that another child gets malaria, but what if there were multiple children playing in the same pond? They could all get bitten by mosquitoes! So, observations / children could potentially be related / dependent on another variable (location).   

__If they say the sample size is large enough:__

Careful! Independence doesn't relate to sample size, we could have hundreds of observations on the SAME person, which WOULD NOT be independent!


# Question 18 

__If they don't state the Chi-Squared statistic (76.8) or the d.f.:__

Careful! The directions state that you should include the test statistic and the associated degrees of freedom. What is the test statistic and what Chi-Square distribution was used to calculate the p-value?

__If they don't state the p-value:__

Careful! You were asked to report the p-value AND compare it to an alpha threshold. It is important for the reader to know how small your p-value was. 

__If they don't reject the null:__

For p-values that are smaller than our alpha threshold, we reject the null hypothesis. A p-value being smaller than 0.05 means that our statistic would happen less than 5% of the time if the null was true, which means it is unlikely the null is true! So, you should reject it! 

__If their conclusion is not in context of at least one proportion being different:__

Go back to #10 and look at your alternative hypothesis! What does that say about the proportion of children who develop malaria? 

__If their conclusion is in terms of the null not the alternative:__

You are correct, the null hypothesis does not seem like a plausible explanation for the relationship between vaccine dose and malaria. So, what would you conclude is a more reasonable explanation?
