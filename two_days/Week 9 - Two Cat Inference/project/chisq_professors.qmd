## Data Description

The data for this project come from end of semester student evaluations for a
large sample of professors from The University of Texas at Austin. The original
data set published in *Beauty in the Classroom* (Hamermesh & Parker, 2005) are
available through the **openintro** `R` package. 

For the Midterm Project, my analysis focused on the relationship between 
professor's attractiveness and course evaluation scores, two numerical variables.
For this analysis, however, I will be focusing on two categorical variables:

- professor's self-identified sex (M / F)
- professor's teaching rank (teaching / tenure track / tenured)

Specifically, I am interested in
investigating if there are larger proportions of male-identifying faculty in 
tenured positions, whereas there are larger proportions of women in teaching
positions. 


## Data Visualization & Summarization
<!-- In this section you create three visualizations of your data -->

### Investigating Professor's Self-Identified Sex

```{r bar-plot-1}
evals_ind %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = sex)
         ) +
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(x = "Professor's Self-Identified Sex", 
       y = "Number of Professors")

evals_ind %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

In the bar plot of professor's sex, we see that there are more male identifying
professors than female identifying professors. Based on the summary table, we 
see there are 14 more male faculty than female faculty. 

### Investigating Professor's Teaching Rank

```{r bar-plot-2}
evals_ind %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = rank)
         ) +
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(x = "Professor's Teaching Rank", 
       y = "Number of Professors")

evals_ind %>% 
  group_by(rank) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

In the bar plot of professor's teaching rank, we see the majority of faculty 
are tenured, over double the number of tenure track faculty at UT Austin. The
smallest group is teaching faculty, with only 15 professors.

### Investigating the Relationship between Professor's Self-Identified Sex and Teaching Rank

```{r bar-plot-3}
evals_ind %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = rank, fill = sex)
         ) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") + 
  labs(x = "Professor's Teaching Rank", 
       y = "Number of Professors", 
       fill = "Professor's Gender")

```

Based on the filled bar plot above, we can see that male professors make up a 
larger percentage of the tenured faculty than for all other teaching ranks. 
Contrary to what I expected, teaching and tenure track have about the same
proportion of female faculty. 


## Independence of Professor's Sex and Teaching Rank

For our chi-squared analysis, we are interested in knowing if a professor's sex
is independent of their teaching rank. If there was no relationship between 
sex and teaching rank, we would expect to see approximately equal proportions of
male identifying faculty across the teaching ranks. 


### Model Conditions

To conduct a chi-squared analysis, there are two conditions required to be
checked, (1) independence of observations and (2) expected cell counts of at
least five for every level of sex and teaching rank. 

As these professors were a convenience sample of professors at UT Austin, not a
random sample, we need to think carefully about independence. There are no
repeated observations of professors in the dataset and knowing the sex and rank
of one faculty member doesn't give you perfect information about another faculty
member. Thus, I do not believe the independence of observations condition is 
violated. 

The table of observed counts is shown below. The smallest observed counts are 
for female and male teaching faculty. To perform a parametric chi-squared 
analysis, we are required to have five expected counts in each cell of the
table. Based on the table, we can see that the cell which should have the lowest
expected count is female, teaching faculty. The expected count for this cell is
$\frac{40 \times 15}{94} = 6.382$, which is larger than 5. 

```{r expected-counts}

evals_ind %>% 
  group_by(sex, rank) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = sex, 
              values_from = n) %>% 
  adorn_totals(where = c("row", "col")) %>% 
  knitr::kable()

```


Since I have not seen any major violations of these conditions, I believe using 
a parametric chi-squared distribution will not incorrectly estimate the p-value
for the test of independence. 


### Chi-Squared Analysis 

The results of the chi-squared analysis are presented below. 

```{r chi-sq-results}
chisq_test(evals_ind, 
           response = rank, 
           explanatory = sex
           ) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

With a p-value of 0.109 (chi-squared statistic = 4.4 on 2 degrees of freedom),
we have weak evidence against the null. At an $\alpha$ of 0.1 we fail to reject
the null hypothesis of independence. Hence, these data do not suggest that a
professor's sex and their teaching rank are dependent.
