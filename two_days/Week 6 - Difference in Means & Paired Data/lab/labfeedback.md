## Question 17 -- Do the results of the CI agree with the p-value? Explain your answer.

__If they recognize 0 is not in the interval:__

Great job! You are correct, since our p-value was smaller than 0.01 we would reject the null hypothesis, which means 0 should not be in our interval. 

__If they talk about the p-value being in the interval:__

A p-value is the probability of obtaining a mean difference of 2.46 or something
larger, if there was no difference in the read times between the two formats
(a mean difference of 0). The confidence interval is the range of values that we
are 99% confident captures the mean difference. The confidence interval will
agree with our hypothesis test, if the null value (0) is not contained in the 
interval! 

__If they say they don't agree:__

If the p-value is less than 0.01, we would reject the null hypothesis. If our 
99% confidence interval does not include 0, then we would also reject the null
hypothesis. The only way these methods would not agree is if you had a p-value
less than 0.01 and your confidence interval contained 0! 


## Question 18 -- The abstract states, that the conflicting color stimuli "caused an increase of 2.3 seconds or 5.6% over the normal time for reading the same words printed in black." Is this statement valid? Explain.

__If they say yes because it was random:__

Careful! What aspect of the study was random? Was it the sample? Was it the order that people read the forms? What type of randomness does a study need to have in order to use cause and effect statements?

__If they say yes because of random assignment, but don't say what was assigned__

Great job recognizing the use of random assignment, but it is important to note what was randomly assigned. What is the people? Was it the order of the forms? 

__If they say yes but not because of randomization:__

This statement agrees with what our analysis found, but the key aspect of their interpretation is the use of the word **CAUSE**. Can the researchers say if printing the names in mismatched colors CAUSED an increase in the time it took to read them? Hint: Look at the description for how they decided what order people read the two lists in. 

__If they say no because there isn't randomization:__

Look back at the description for how they decided what order people read the two lists in. In the case of paired data, we don't have a control group. Instead, each person is assigned both "treatments" -- here they read both lists. 

__If they say no because it's observational:__

Careful! Experiments have random assignment rather than us just observing the time it takes people to read two different lists of words. The researchers in this study randomly assigned which list a person read first versus second.
