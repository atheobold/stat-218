# Completion Credit

If they have responses for every question, they receive full credit.

**If they don't have answers to questions 7 and / or 8**

Your HTML file doesn't have your answers to any of the questions in the lab. This is probably because you didn't render the file one last time after you typed your answers. Please go back to the Lab 1 assignment in RStudio Cloud and render your file again, look over the HTML and double check that your answers are included in the document. Then download your HTML again and re-upload it to the assignment. 

If you have questions about this process, please email Dr. Theobold. :) 

# Example Feedback for Lab

## Question 7

**If they say the observations are dates of Broadway shows (correct)**

Great job! You are spot on! Each row / observation is one week of a specific Broadway show, that's why Miss Saigon has lots of rows--each row is one week.

**If they say the observations are Broadway shows (incorrect)**

You are on the right track, the observations are Broadway shows, but there are multiple rows for each Broadway show. We need to figure out what separates these shows from each other. Look again and see what separates these rows from each
other!

## Question 8

**Look for the general idea of variable names**

Nice job! The variable names are at the top of each column. You got the general idea of what types of variables these data contain. 

**If they talk about data types (categorical / numerical)**

Nice work thinking about what types of variables these are! You are on the right track noticing that variables like attendance and gross are numerical, while month actually behaves like a categorical variable (even though it has numbers).
