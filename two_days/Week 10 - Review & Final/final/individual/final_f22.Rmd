\textbf{Q3} [24 pts] 
In 2004, the state of North Carolina released to the public a large dataset
containing information on births recorded in this state. This data set has been 
of interest to medical researchers who are studying the relation between habits
and practices of expectant mothers and the birth of their children. This 
analysis will focus on a random sample of 981 observations from the published
dataset. 

\vspace{0.25cm}

\noindent
\textbf{(a)} [3 pts] Hospital administration at Duke University Hospital are
interested in the difference in the mean baby birth weight between mothers who do not
smoke and mothers who do smoke. Using the table below, report the observed
statistic for this comparison. Indicate in your answer what notation should be
used for this statistic. 

\vspace{0.25cm}

  labs(x = "Weight of Baby (lbs)", 
       y = "Number of Babies") +

```

\newpage

\noindent
\textbf{(b)} [4 pts] These hospital administrators are
interested in estimating the true difference in mean birth weight between
mothers who do not smoke and mothers who do smoke. The administrators learned in
their Statistics class how to obtain a confidence interval for a difference in
means using a $t$-distribution. Using the plots above and your knowledge of how
the data were collected evaluate whether it would be appropriate for the
administrators to use a $t$-distribution to obtain a confidence interval for the
true difference in means.

\vspace{1.5in}

\noindent
\textbf{(c)} [5 pts] The administrators contacted the Department of Statistics
at Duke and requested a consultation. The Statistician they spoke with suggested
they use bootstrapping instead of a $t$-distribution to obtain a confidence
interval. Fill in the blanks below to explain to the administrators how one
bootstrap (re)sample is found.

bootstrap resamples using the order (`nonsmoker` - `smoker`) and obtained the
bootstrap distribution below. 

Where is the bootstrap distribution centered? Why is the distribution centered 
at that value?

\noindent
\textbf{Q4} [21 pts] As you may be aware, many individuals are concerned about
the presence of BPA in plastics, especially plastics that make contact with food
and drinks. Currently, these is an incomplete understanding of how exposure to
BPA affects our ingestion. Last year Dr. Hagobian in the Kinesiology and Public
Health carried out a study to investigate the role of Bisphenol A (BPA) in 
metabolism and endocrine disruption. 

Dr. Hahobian recruited 11 subjects, each of whom ate two types of cookies on two
separate visits, one visit in December and the second in February. On one visit
they ate the BPA-laced cookie and, on a different day, a placebo cookie (with no
BPA). Thirty minutes after eating the cookie on each occasion, they were given a
glucose tolerance test to measure their glucose metabolism. 

A summary of the glucose test results (mmol/L) after eating each type of cookie
as well as the difference in glucose results for each subject is shown below.

| Cookie                    | Mean   | Standard Deviation | n  |
|---------------------------|:------:|:-----------------:|:---:|
| Placebo                   |	5.259  | 0.762              | 11 |
| BPA	                      | 5.355	 | 1.462              |	11 |
| Difference: Placebo - BPA | -0.095 | 1.153              | 11 |

\newpage

\noindent
\textbf{(a)} [4 pts] For simplicity, Dr. Hagobian could have given all
subjects the BPA cookie on their first visit in December, and the Placebo cookie
on the second visit in February, but he didn’t. Instead, when a subject came for
their first visit, he flipped a coin. If it was heads, they received BPA on that
visit (and Placebo on their second visit). If it was tails they received the 
Placebo cookie first. Why did he add this extra coin flipping step instead of
the simpler approach of just giving everyone one type of cookie in December and
the other type in February?

\vspace{1in}

\noindent
\textbf{(b)} [2 pts] Dr. Hagobian is interested in testing whether BPA causes a shift
in glucose levels. Which analysis would be more appropriate? Circle one.

Which of the following would be the best overall conclusion in the context of 
Dr. Hagobian's study? Your selection should reflect the hypotheses you wrote in
part (c)!

\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] With such a large p-value, we have significant evidence to reject the
null hypothesis. We conclude the true mean of the differences in glucose 
between eating a BPA cracker and a Placebo cracker is not 0. 

\item[(ii)] With such a large p-value, we have insufficient evidence to reject
the null hypothesis. We conclude the true mean of the differences in glucose 
between eating a BPA cracker and a Placebo cracker is 0. 

\item[(iii)] With such a large p-value, we have insufficient evidence to reject
the null hypothesis. We do not have evidence to suggest the mean of the
differences in glucose between eating a BPA cracker and a Placebo cracker is
different from 0. 

\item[(vi)] With such a large p-value, we have significant evidence to reject
the null hypothesis. We conclude the true mean glucose after eating a BPA
cracker is different from the true mean glucose after eating a Placebo cracker.

\item[(v)] With such a large p-value, we have insufficient evidence to reject
the null hypothesis. We conclude there is no difference in the true mean glucose
after eating a BPA cracker and the true mean glucose after eating a Placebo
cracker.

\item[(vi)] With such a large p-value, we have insufficient evidence to reject 
the null hypothesis. We do not have evidence to suggest the true mean glucose
after eating a BPA cracker is different from the true mean glucose after eating
a Placebo cracker.

\textbf{(h)} [2 pts] In a different study, Dr. Hagobian obtained a p-value of
0.0425 and a 95% confidence interval of (-1.129, 0.0437). Which of the 
following statements about these findings is true? Circle one.  

\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] The results of the hypothesis test and the confidence interval tend to 
agree with each other at the 5\% significance level. Four percent of the time we
would obtain a statistic like the one we saw somewhere in the interval of 
-1.129 mmol/L to 0.0437 mmol/L. 

\item[(ii)] The results of the hypothesis test and the confidence interval are
conflicting at the 5\% significance level. With a p-value of 0.0425 we have 
evidence to reject the null hypothesis, which would mean that our confidence 
interval would not contain 0.

\item[(iii)] The results of the hypothesis test and the confidence interval are 
conflicting at the 5\% significance level. There's a 95% chance that a statistic
of 0.0425 would be in the interval (-1.129, 0.0437). 

\item[(vi)] The results of the hypothesis test and the confidence interval seem to 
agree with one another at the 5\% significance level. With a p-value of 0.0425
we do not have evidence to reject the null hypothesis, thus indicating that 0
should be in our interval.

<!-- Questions 1, 2, 5, 7, 9 -->

\noindent \textbf{Q1} [17 pts]
Wild mushrooms, such as chanterelles or morels, are delicious, but eating wild
mushrooms carries the risk of accidental poisoning. Even a single bite of the
wrong mushroom can be enough to cause fatal poisoning. An amateur mushroom
hunter is interested in finding an easy rule to differentiate poisonous and
edible mushrooms. They think that the mushroom’s gills (the part which holds and
releases spores) might be related to a mushroom’s edibility. They used a data
set of 8124 mushrooms and their descriptions. For each mushroom, the data set
includes whether it is edible or poisonous and the spacing of the gills (Broad
or Narrow). 

**Please Note**: According to The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American
Mushrooms, there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom;
no rule like "leaflets three, leave them be" for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.

```{r mushroom-data, include = FALSE}

\noindent \textbf{Q2} [21 pts]

Mendelian inheritance refers to certain patterns of how traits are passed from parents to offspring. These general patterns were established by the Austrian
monk Gregor Mendel, who performed thousands of experiments with pea plants in
the 19th century. Mendel’s discoveries of how traits (such as color and shape)
are passed down from one generation to the next introduced the concept of
dominant and recessive modes of inheritance.

Mendelian inheritance refers to the inheritance of traits controlled by a single
gene with two alleles, one of which may be completely dominant to the other.
You can use a Punnett square to determine the expected ratios of 
possible genotypes in the offspring of two parents. 

In the table below, we see an example of eye color inheritance. In this case, 
both parents are heterozygotes (Aa) for the gene. Half of the gametes produced
by each parent will have the A allele, and half will have the a allele, shown
on the side and the top of the Punnett square. Filling in the cells of the
Punnett square gives the possible genotypes of their children. It also shows the
most likely ratios of the genotypes, which in this case is 25% AA, 50% Aa, and 
25% aa.

![](figures/punnetts.png)

\newpage

\noindent \textbf{(a)} [2 pts] When Mendel crossed his pea plants, he learned
that tall (T) was dominant to short (t). Suppose in your Biology course you
carried out an experiment to test if the plot offspring would follow Mendelian
inheritance. 

\noindent Fill in the cells of Punnett square to give the possible genotypes for
plant tallness. 

|                   |         T                 |               t       |
|-------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|
|       T           |                           |               |
|                   |                   |               |
|       t           |                   |               |


\noindent \textbf{(b)} [3 pts] If the Mendelian inheritance is true, what
proportions would you expect for each of the following genotypes? Insert the corresponding values in each cell. 

\vspace{0.25cm}

| TT                          | Tt                         | tt               |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|
| $\pi_{\text{TT}}$ =           | $\pi_{\text{Tt}}$ =          | $\pi_{\text{tt}}$ = |
|                             |                            |                  |

\vspace{0.25cm}

\noindent \textbf{(c)} [2 pts] Actually, our table could be a bit simpler.
Both the TT and Tt genotypes will present as "tall" plants, whereas tt genotypes
will present as "short" plants.

\noindent Compress your previous table into a new table with only two levels
of tallness. 

| Tall                                 | Short                              |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| $\pi_{\text{Tall}}$ =                  | $\pi_{\text{Short}}$ =               |
|                                      |                                    |

\vspace{0.25cm}

\noindent \textbf{(d)} [3 pts] If the table above represents what Mendelian 
inheritance assumes to be true about tallness under $H_0,$ state the alternative
hypothesis using words. 

\vspace{1in}

\noindent \textbf{(e)} [2 point] After you cross your plants, you measure the
characteristics of the 400 offspring. You note that there are 305 tall pea
plants and 95 short pea plants. 

\noindent Fill in the table summarizing these observed counts. 

| $\underline{\hspace{1in}}$ | $\underline{\hspace{1in}}$ | Total       |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|-------------|
|                            |                            |    400      |

\newpage

\noindent \textbf{(f)} [2 pts] Fill in the table below, summarizing the
expected counts for these 400 plants. 

| $\underline{\hspace{1in}}$ | $\underline{\hspace{1in}}$ | Total       |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|-------------|
|                            |                            |    400      |

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent \textbf{(g)} [4 pts] Calculate how far "off" was your observed
number of tall and short plants were from what you expected if $H_0$ was true.
Use these values to report the $X^2$ statistic for your experiment. 

__Tall__:

\vspace{0.5in}

__Short:__

\vspace{0.5in}

__$X^2$ statistic__:

\vspace{0.25in}

\noindent \textbf{(h)} [3 pts] The p-value associated with your $X^2$
statistic is `r pchisq(0.3319, df = 1, lower.tail = FALSE)`. Your Biology
textbook suggests you interpret this value as:

> *The large p-value proves that Mendelian inheritance is true.*

\noindent What issue(s) to you have with this interpretation?

\textbf{Q5} [11 pts] 
The effect of guilt on how a decision maker focuses on a problem was
investigated in the *Journal of Behavioral Decision Making* (January 2007). A
total of 155 volunteer students participated in the study, where each was
randomly assigned to one of three emotional states (guilt, anger, or neutral)
through a reading / writing task. Immediately after the task, the students were
presented with a decision problem (e.g., whether or not to spend money on
repairing a very old car). The researchers found that a higher proportion of
students in the guilty-state group chose not to repair the car than those in the neutral-state and anger-state groups.

\vspace{0.25in}

\noindent
\textbf{(a)} [3 pts] What is the study design? Select one.

\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] Observational study. The researchers did not take a random sample of
students.
\item[(ii)] Observational study. There is no random assignment of students to 
emotional state.
\item[(iii)] Experiment. The students are a representative sample of all
students.
\item[(iv)] Experiment. The students were randomly assigned to emotional state.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.25cm}

\noindent \textbf{(b)} [3 pts] Which types of sampling bias may be present in
this study? Select all that are present, or if you believe there is no bias 
present, select option (iv) No bias.

\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] Selection bias
\item[(ii)] Non-response bias
\item[(iii)] Response bias
\item[(iv)] No bias
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.25cm}

\noindent \textbf{(c)} [3 pts] The researchers found a difference in the 
proportion of students in the guilty-state group chose not to repair the car
than those in the neutral-state and anger-state groups. Can we conclude that the emotional state group caused a higher proportion of students to not repair the
car? Select one.

\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] Yes, because these data are from a representative sample.
\item[(ii)] No, because the students are volunteers.
\item[(iii)] Yes, because the researchers evened out confounding variables
across emotional state group by randomly assigning emotional state.
\item[(iv)] No, because the sample size is not large enough.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.25cm}

\noindent \textbf{(d)} [2 pts] Which type of plot would be the **most**
appropriate to display the relationship between each level of emotional state
and whether students choose to repair the car? Select one. 

\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] Scatterplot
\item[(ii)] Filled bar plot
\item[(iii)] Pie chart
\item[(iv)] Side-by-side boxplot

\noindent \textbf{Q7} [2 pts] Suppose you reject the null hypothesis at the
0.05 level of significance. A colleague had planned to use a 0.01 level of
significance instead. Will your colleague also reject the null hypothesis?

\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Yes
