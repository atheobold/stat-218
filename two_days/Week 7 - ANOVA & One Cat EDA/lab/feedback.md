## Feedback on Axis Labels

### Question 4

- x-axis: something about amount of light when sleeping
- y-axis: something about frequencies / counts

**If they don't put "child" on the y-axis**

"What are the units of study for these data? These are frequencies of what?"

### Question 6 

- x-axis: something about amount of sight
- y-axis: something about proportions

**If they don't change to proportions on the y-axis**

"Careful! What is being plotted in #6? Look at the values on the y-axis and how this compares to the first plot of myopia!"

### If you see `labs()` output separate from the plot

"Careful! Your axis labels aren't included on your plot because you were missing a + to connect this line to the previous line."

## Question 7

**If they don't say the bars all go up to 100%**

"Yes, you are correct, all of the bars look the same without the group = 1 option. But these bars all go up to a specific value. What is that value?"

## Question 18 

"You are on the right track, the proportion of children with myopia who slept with a nightlight is different from children who did not. But, statistically, we need to assess if that difference is **large**. Based on the bar plots, did it seem like the proportion of green (myopia) is **substantially** different between the light groups?"
