# This is where you will load in your data! 
# I suggest copying and pasting code from a prior lab.

# 1. the name of the dataset (you get to choose the name)
# 2. directions for how to get to the data

## Data Description
<!-- In this section you are to describe your dataset! -->

<!-- This section has three tasks:
1. Describe the context of your dataset in your own words!
2. Tell me why you picked this dataset
3. Describe the two variables you are interested in. One should be the
explanatory variable and one should be the response.
-->


## Data Visualization & Summarization
<!-- In this section you create three visualizations of your data -->

### Investigating <NAME OF EXPLANATORY VARIABLE>

```{r bar-plot-1}
## Code for bar plot:


## Code for summary table:


```
<!-- Description of what you see in the bar plot and in the summary table! -->



### Investigating <NAME OF RESPONSE VARIABLE>

```{r bar-plot-2}
## Code for bar plot:


## Code for summary table:


```
<!-- Description of what you see in the bar plot and in the summary table! -->



### Investigating the Relationship between <NAME OF RESPONSE VARIABLE> and 
<NAME OF EXPLANATORY VARIABLE>

```{r bar-plot-3}
## Code for bar plot:
## No summary table necessary, since you will be making one to check the model conditions! :) 



```
<!-- Description of what you see in the bar plot and in the summary table! -->



## Independence of <NAME OF RESPONSE VARIABLE> and <NAME OF EXPLANATORY VARIABLE>
<!-- Description of what is being tested in your analysis! -->


### Model Conditions
<!-- Here is where you describe the two conditions for a theory-based chi-squared analysis. -->

<!-- Discuss the independence of observation condition: -->



<!-- Discuss the expected cell count condition: -->



```{r expected-counts}
## This is code that will generate the table of observed counts for you!
## You need to fill in the name of your dataset & your variables!

<NAME OF DATASET> %>% 
  group_by(<VARIABLE1>, <VARIABLE2>) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = <VARIABLE1>, 
              values_from = n) %>% 
  adorn_totals(where = c("row", "col"))

```

<!-- State whether using a theory-based method is appropriate, given your conditions. -->



### Chi-Squared Analysis 

```{r chi-sq-results}
## Insert code to carry out a chi-squared analysis of your variables
## If you did not have expected counts of at least 5, you need to have a simulation-based method here!!!



```

<!-- Discuss the results of your analysis. What do you conclude about the relationship between your variables? -->
