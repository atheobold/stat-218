STEP 1: Research question. How much do STAT 218 students sleep on a typical night? Letâ€™s make the question more clear: Is the average number of hours of sleep for any given night less than the recommended eight hours? How can we estimate this average?


<!-- t-distribution -->

<!-- SE method for CI -->

<!-- t-based CI -->

<!-- t-test for mu_0 -->

__17. There is one requirement for using the SE method to construct a 
confidence interval. What is this requirement? Can we safely use the SE method 
to construct a confidence 


```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
sleep_hours %>%
  specify(response = hours) %>% 
  hypothesize(null = "point", mu = 8) %>% 
  assume(distribution = "t") %>% 
  visualize() +
  labs(x = "t-statistic", 
       y = "Density", 
       title = "Theory-Based Null Distribution")

```
