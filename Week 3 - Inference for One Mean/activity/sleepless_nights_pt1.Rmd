## Step 1: Research Question

For any statistical investigation, we need to start with a research question 
we are interested in studying. For this activity, we will consider how much do
STAT 218 students sleep on a typical night? Let’s make the question more clear:
Is the average number of hours of sleep for any given night less than the
recommended eight hours? 


__1. Based on the research question, what is the unit of study, the population of
interest, the variable, and the parameter (and symbol)?__

- Unit of Study:

</br>
</br>

- Population:

</br>
</br>

- Variable:

</br>
</br>

- Parameter:

</br>
</br>

- Parameter Symbol:

</br>
</br>


## Step 2: Design a Study

We will investigate whether the mean amount of sleep last night for the
population of all STAT 218 students was less than 8 hours. 

</br>

### Null and Alternative Hypotheses:

Ho: The population mean hours of sleep for all 218 students is 8 hours.
Ha: The population mean hours of sleep for all 218 students is less than 8
hours.


__2. How would you write these hypotheses using notation instead of words?__ 

__$H_0$:__

</br></br>

__$H_A$:__

</br></br>

To test these hypotheses, we need to collect data. Ideally a simple random
sample should be collected in order to avoid bias in our sampling method. 
However, this would take a fair bit of work. 

__3. Two sections of STAT 218 were randomly selected out of all of the sections
of STAT 218 to obtain 50 STAT 218 students. What type of sampling method could
this be?__

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>


This method of sampling could be biased in some form. We will revisit the
implications of using two classes as a sample of STAT 218 students later when we
evaluate the study. For now, let’s consider our results.


## Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis 

```{r sim-data, echo = FALSE}

sleep_hours <- rnorm(n = 50, 
                     mean = 6.8, 
                     sd = 1) %>% 
  tibble::tibble(hours = .) %>% 
  mutate(student = row_number(.), 
         hours = case_when(hours <= 4 ~ 4,
                           between(hours, 4.01, 4.5) ~ 4.5,
                           between(hours, 4.501, 4.99) ~ 5, 
                           between(hours, 5, 5.499) ~ 5.5,
                           between(hours, 5.5, 5.9) ~ 6, 
                           between(hours, 6, 6.49) ~ 6.5, 
                           between(hours, 6.5, 6.99) ~ 7, 
                           between(hours, 7, 7.49) ~ 7.5, 
                           between(hours, 7.5, 7.99) ~ 8, 
                           between(hours, 8, 8.49) ~ 8.5, 
                           hours >= 8.5 ~ 9
                           ), 
         hours = replace_na(hours, replace = 6.5)
         ) %>% 
  arrange(student)

#write_csv(sleep_hours, "sleep_hours.csv")


```

The histogram and the statistical measures below summarize the distribution of
sleep hours for the 50 sampled STAT 218 students.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = sleep_hours, 
       mapping = aes(x = hours)
       ) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(x = "Hours Slept in Sample of 50 STAT 218 Students", 
       y = "Number of Students")

```

```{r eda, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = sleep_hours, 
       mapping = aes(x = hours)
       ) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(x = "Hours Slept in Sample of 50 STAT 218 Students", 
       y = "Number of Students") + 
  my_theme

# Add breaks at the half increments!
```

</br>
</br>


```{r}
favstats(~ hours, data = sleep_hours)
```

</br>

After your data are collected, the next step is to explore them! In the case of
a quantitative variable exploring the data consists of visualizing the
distribution of the responses and calculating summary statistics, to describe
the shape, center, variability, and unusual observations. 

</br>
</br>

__4. Describe the distribution of the sample above.__

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

## Step 4: Draw inferences beyond the data

Now that we have explored the data and better understand the distribution of
sleep hours for the sample of STAT 218 students, we will use both simulation
and theory-based approaches to evaluate the claim that STAT 218 students get
less than the recommended amount of sleep they should (8 hours). 

We will use two different statistical methods to evaluate the evidence our
data provide: 

1. Simulation
2. Mathematical Theory

### Simulation-Based Approach

To evaluate how much evidence our data provide against the null hypothesis, we 
need to know what means we could expect from other samples of STAT 218 students!

#### Statistic 

The first step is to remind yourself of the average number of hours of sleep
for the sample of STAT 218 students. 

__5. $\bar{x}=$__

</br>

#### One Simulation

To know what other means we could expect to get from a different sample of STAT
218 students we will use **bootstrapping**. A "bootstrap" is a method of 
resampling from the original sample to obtain a "new" sample. 

For boostrapping, the **critical** assumption we are making is that the students
in our original sample are "representative" of the population of STAT 218
students. If this is true, then we can view each resample as similar to another
sample that we could have gotten when sampling from the entire population. 

You have been given a bag of 50 cards, where each card has the observed
number of hours slept for a STAT 218 student. 

</br>

__6. Your team should resample (with replacement) 50 cards from the bag, writing
down each number before putting the card back in. Once you have 50 values, find
the mean number of hours slept in your resample.__

$\bar{x}=$

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

__7. Write down or plot the bootstrap means other groups obtained.__

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

#### Thousands of Simulations

Alright, you obtained one resample, but getting 100 resamples using our card
method would take us a long time (and would be really boring). So, we will use
the computer, specifically `R`, to help us get bootstrap resamples much quicker!

To obtain a boostrap resample, we have a three step process:

1. `specify` what the response variable is
2. `generate` ____ boostrap resamples
3. `calculate` the mean for each bootstrap resample

The code below does that for us and saves them in a new dataset called 
`bootstrap_resamples`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sleep_hours %>%
  specify(response = hours) %>% 
  generate(reps = 20, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean")
```

Here is a preview of what these bootstrap resamples look like:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
sleep_hours %>%
  specify(response = hours) %>% 
  generate(reps = 10, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean")
```

__8. What does the `replicate` column correspond to?__

</br>
</br>

__9. What does the `stat` column correspond to?__

</br>
</br>

__10. Of these 10 resamples, what is the smallest mean that was obtained? What
was the largest mean that was obtained?__

</br>
</br>

__11. If you were to make a histogram or a dotplot of these 10 means, where 
do you believe it would be centered?__


#### Bootstrap Distribution

Alright, to get a good idea of what means we might get from other samples, we
will obtain lots of bootstrap resamples. Typically, we will use *at least*
1,000 resamples, so we get a good idea of what the distribution of the boostrap
statistics looks like. 

The distribution of bootstrap statistics (in this case means) has a specific 
name. We call this the **bootstrap distribution**. I've run the code to obtain
1,000 bootstrap resamples and plotted the results in the histogram below. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
bootstrap_resamples <- sleep_hours %>%
  specify(response = hours) %>% 
  generate(reps = 10000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean") 

bootstrap_resamples %>% 
  visualize(method = "simulation") +
  labs(x = "", 
       y = "", 
       title = "") + 
  my_theme
```

</br>

__12. Fill in the x-axis and y-axis labels for the bootstrap distribution.__

</br>

__13. How would you describe the shape of the distribution?__

</br>
</br>
</br>

__14. Where is the distribution centered? Why do you believe it is centered
there?__

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

### Step 5: Making Conclusions

We use a bootstrap distribution to see the variability in the statistics we 
might have seen from other samples from the population. These different
statistics give us an idea as to where we believe the population parameter 
might lie. 

__15. What is the population parameter we are trying to estimate?__

</br>
</br>


There are two ways to obtain a confidence interval, (1) using the "percentile"
method and (2) using the "SE" method. 

The percentile method uses percentiles to decide the endpoints of the interval. 
I've provided a table of different percentiles to help you create your
confidence interval. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
bootstrap_resamples %>% 
  summarize("0.5%" = quantile(stat, 0.05), 
            "1%" = quantile(stat, 0.01),
            "2.5%" = quantile(stat, 0.025),
            "5%" = quantile(stat, 0.05),
            "90%" = quantile(stat, 0.90),
            "95%" = quantile(stat, 0.95),
            "97.5%" = quantile(stat, 0.975),
            "99.5%" = quantile(stat, 0.95)
            ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), 
               names_to = "Quantile", 
               values_to = "Value") %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

</br>

__16. Suppose we are interested in constructing a 95% confidence interval. Using 
the table above, report the end points of this confidence interval.__

</br>
</br>

__17. Interpret the confidence interval in the context of this investigation.__

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

__18. Given the values of your 95% confidence interval, do you believe it is 
reasonable to assume that STAT 218 students get 8 hours of sleep? Why or 
why not?__
