## Step 1: Research Question

For any statistical investigation, we need to start with a research question 
we are interested in studying. For this activity, we will consider how much do
STAT 218 students sleep on a typical night? Let’s make the question more clear:
Is the average number of hours of sleep for any given night less than the
recommended eight hours? 


1. Based on the research question, what is the unit of study, the population of
interest, the variable, and the parameter (and symbol)?

__Population:__

__Variable:__

__Parameter:__

__Parameter Symbol:__

## Step 2: Design a Study

We will investigate whether the mean amount of sleep last night for the
population of all STAT 218 students was less than 8 hours. 

### Null and Alternative Hypotheses:

Ho: The population mean hours of sleep for all 218 students is 8 hours.
Ha: The population mean hours of sleep for all 218 students is less than 8
hours.


2. How would you write these hypotheses using notation instead of words? 

__$H_0$:__

__$H_A$:__

To test these hypotheses, we need to collect data. Ideally a simple random
sample should be collected in order to avoid bias in our sampling method. 
However, this would take a fair bit of work. 

3.	Two sections of STAT 218 were randomly selected out of all of the sections
of STAT 218 to obtain 50 STAT 218 students. What type of sampling method could
this be?

This method of sampling could be biased in some form. We will revisit the
implications of using two classes as a sample of STAT 218 students later when we
evaluate the study. For now, let’s consider our results.
