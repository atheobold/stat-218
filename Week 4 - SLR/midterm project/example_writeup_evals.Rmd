## Data Description
<!-- This section has three tasks:
1. Describe the context of your dataset in your own words!
2. Tell me why you picked this dataset
3. Describe the two variables you are interested in. One should be the
explanatory variable and one should be the response.
-->

Today, most colleges require the teaching of faculty to be evaluated through 
anonymous student evaluations. Historically, student evaluations date back to 
the 1920s, where faculty were in favor of this form of evaluation replacing the
casual judgments of lone administrators. Faculty were largely dissatisfied with
the alternatives, and eventually most accepted the premise of student
evaluations. Professors today, however, look a lot different than professors in
the 1920s or even the 1970s. 

The data for this project come from end of semester student evaluations for a
large sample of professors from The University of Texas at Austin. The original
data set published in *Beauty in the Classroom* (Hamermesh & Parker, 2005) are
available through the **openintro** R package. 

I am interested in these data because I have read numerous papers on how 
teaching evaluations to be biased against women and people of color. Many of
these papers, similar to the *Beauty in the Classroom* article, propose that 
student evaluations often reflect biases in favor of non-teaching related
characteristics, such as the physical appearance of the instructor. These data
allow for me to explor the relationship between professor's attractiveness and
their teaching evaluations. 

For this project, I will focus on two variables: the average attractiveness of 
the professor and the professor's average course evaluation score. The study had
six students rate the attractiveness of each professor based on their picture 
from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest). The average of these six scores is the variable
used for this project. 

## Data Visualization
<!-- In this section you create three visualizations of your data -->

### Histogram of Average Teaching Evalution Scores

```{r histogram-1}
evals %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = score)
         ) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.37) + 
  labs(x = "Average Course Evaluation Score (from all student responses)", 
       y = "Number of Professors")

```
<!-- Here is where you describe what you see in the histogram. Your description must include the following components: center, spread, shape, outliers -->



### Histogram of Average Attractiveness Scores

```{r histogram-2}
evals %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = bty_avg)
         ) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.7) + 
  labs(x = "Average Attractiveness (Scored by 6 Students)", 
       y = "Number of Professors")

```
<!-- Here is where you describe what you see in the histogram. Your description must include the following components: center, spread, shape, outliers -->



### Scatterplot of Avearge Beauty Score and Average Course Evaluation Score

```{r scatterplot}
evals %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = bty_avg, 
                       y = score)
         ) +
  geom_jitter() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(x = "Average Attractiveness (Scored by 6 Students)", 
       y = "Average Course Evaluation Score (from all student responses)")

```

<!-- Here is where you describe what you see in the scatterplot. Your description must include the following components: direction, shape, strength, outliers -->


## Linear Relationship Between <INSERT NAME OF RESPONSE VARIABLE> and <INSERT NAME OF EXPLANATORY VARIABLE>

### Model Conditions

__Linearity:__

__Independence:__

__Normality:__

__Equal Variance:__


### Coefficient Estimates

```{r lm}
## Code to fit a linear regression
eval_lm <- lm(score ~ bty_avg, data = evals)

## Code to get coefficient table from linear regression
get_regression_table(eval_lm, conf.level = 0.90) %>% 
  kable()
```

### Inference for the Slope

<!-- Here is where you describe the decision for the hypothesis test for whether the slope is 0.  -->



<!-- Here is where you describe the confidence interval for the true slope. -->
