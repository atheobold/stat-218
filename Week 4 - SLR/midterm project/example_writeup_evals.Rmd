## Data Description

Today, most colleges require the teaching of faculty to be evaluated through 
anonymous student evaluations. Historically, student evaluations date back to 
the 1920s, where faculty were in favor of this form of evaluation replacing the
casual judgments of lone administrators. Faculty were largely dissatisfied with
the alternatives, and eventually most accepted the premise of student
evaluations. Professors today, however, look a lot different than professors in
the 1920s or even the 1970s. 

The data for this project come from end of semester student evaluations for a
large sample of professors from The University of Texas at Austin. The original
data set published in *Beauty in the Classroom* (Hamermesh & Parker, 2005) are
available through the **openintro** R package. 

I am interested in these data because I have read numerous papers on how 
teaching evaluations to be biased against women and people of color. Many of
these papers, similar to the *Beauty in the Classroom* article, propose that 
student evaluations often reflect biases in favor of non-teaching related
characteristics, such as the physical appearance of the instructor. These data
allow for me to explor the relationship between professor's attractiveness and
their teaching evaluations. 

For this project, I will focus on two variables: the average attractiveness of 
the professor and the professor's average course evaluation score. The study had
six students rate the attractiveness of each professor based on their picture 
from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest). The average of these six scores is the variable
used for this project. 

## Data Visualization
<!-- In this section you create three visualizations of your data -->

### Histogram of Average Teaching Evalution Scores

```{r histogram-1}
evals %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = score)
         ) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.37) + 
  labs(x = "Average Course Evaluation Score (from all student responses)", 
       y = "Number of Professors")

```

In the histogram of course evaluation scores we see that the most frequent
scores are around 4.5. The lowest scores these professors received was a 2 
and the highest scores was a 5. The distribution is unimodal and left skewed,
with most of the professors receiving scores over 3.5. Since the scores range
from 0 to 5, this distribution suggests that, overall, students rate these 
professors favorably. 

### Histogram of Average Attractiveness Scores

```{r histogram-2}
evals %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = bty_avg)
         ) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.7) + 
  labs(x = "Average Attractiveness (Scored by 6 Students)", 
       y = "Number of Professors")

```
<!-- Here is where you describe what you see in the histogram. Your description must include the following components: center, spread, shape, outliers -->

In the histogram of attractivness scores, we see a unimodal distribution with a
slight right skew. The majority of professors received an average attractiveness
score of about 4. There were a few professors who received low attractiveness 
scores of about 2, but I would not consider these outliers as they are not far
from the center of the distribtuion. However, there are professors who received
average attractiveness scores of over 7.5, which I would classify as potential 
outliers, as they are quite far from the center of the distribution.

### Scatterplot of Avearge Beauty Score and Average Course Evalution Score

```{r scatterplot}
evals %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = bty_avg, 
                       y = score)
         ) +
  geom_jitter() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(x = "Average Attractiveness (Scored by 6 Students)", 
       y = "Average Course Evaluation Score (from all student responses)")

```

<!-- Here is where you describe what you see in the scatterplot. Your description must include the following components: direction, shape, strength, outliers -->

In the scattterplot we see a postive relationship between professor's
attractivness and their course evaluation score. The relationship is weak to 
moderate, as there is a great deal of varibility in course evaluation scores 
across all levels of attractiveness. This variability makes it more difficult 
to say the shape of the relationship, but I would say there is a weak linear
relationship between these two variables. Finally, there are a few outliers, 
namely the professors with course evaluation scores under 3 and attractiveness
scores below 2. These are both far from the center (high leverage) and far from
the regression line, which suggests they may be quite influential. 


## Linear Relationship Between Average Course Evaluation Scores and Average
Beauty Score

### Model Conditions

There are four conditions required to be verified before we perform inference
on the linear relationship between these two variables. These conditions are:
linearity of the relationship, independence of observations, nearly normal
residuals, and constant variability. 

__Linearity:__ As seen 

__Independence:__

__Normality:__

__Equal Variance:__


### Coefficient Estimates

```{r lm}
## Code to fit a linear regression
eval_lm <- lm(score ~ bty_avg, data = evals)

## Code to get coefficient table from linear regression
get_regression_table(eval_lm, conf.level = 0.90) %>% 
  kable()
```
