**Note: Ordinal and nominal variables will be treated the same in this course.
I recommend taking more statistics courses in the future to learn better
methods of analysis for ordinal variables!**

#### Notes

Big Idea: Variability is inevitable!  We would not expect to get _exactly_ 50 heads in 100 coin flips.  The statistical question then is whether any
differences found in data are due to random variability, or if something else
is going on.  

> The larger the difference, the **less we believe the difference was due to chance.**

In a data frame, rows correspond to ___________________ 

and columns correspond to __________________.

How many types of variables are discussed?  Explain the differences between them and give an example of each.

True or False: A pair of variables can be both associated AND independent.

</br>

True or False: Given a pair of variables, one will always be the explanatory variable and one the response variable.  

</br>

True or False: If a study does have an explanatory and a response variable,
that means changes in the explanatory variable must **cause** changes in the
response variable. 

</br>

True or False: Observational studies can show a naturally occurring association
between variables.
