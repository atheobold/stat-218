# Question 6

Nice work using glimpse() to preview the dataset! This is a great function for obtaining information about the name of the columns and a preview of the observations within each column. 

## If they use read_csv() with assignment

The read_csv() function reads in the data, but it isn't a great function for previewing a dataset. The messages read_csv() gives you is about *how* it read in the dataset you specified, which isn't very helpful in getting information about the variables and the observations. I would recommend using the glimpse() function instead. 

## If use read_csv() without assignment

The read_csv() function reads in the data, but it isn't a great function for previewing a dataset. The messages read_csv() gives you is about *how* it read in the dataset you specified, which isn't very helpful in getting information about the variables and the observations. Technically, the only reason you are getting a preview of the dataset is because you didn't save the data anywhere (using a <-). 

Although you get a preview of the dataset this way, I was hoping for you to use the glimpse() function instead. 


# Question 7

The rows are much more than *one* Broadway show! There are multiple rows for each Broadway show. Look again and see what separates these rows from each other!

# Question 8

## If use read_csv() without assignment

The variables are all of the columns listed when you read in the dataset! read_csv() tells you what columns were read in as each type of data -- chr variables are categorical and dbl variables are numerical. 

You also get this information from the data preview!
