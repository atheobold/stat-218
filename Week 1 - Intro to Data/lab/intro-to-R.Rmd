### General information on Wednesday labs

Each Wednesday you will complete a lab in class with your group. Questions are
selected from each lab to be turned in on Canvas (one submission per group).
The questions to be submitted on Canvas are bolded in the lab.  As you work
through the lab with your group have the Canvas lab assignment open so that you
can answer those questions as you go. Today's activity is Lab 1 in Canvas for
practice submitting as a group.


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for
authoring HTML, PDF, and Microsoft Word documents. 

The document may look a bit different that you are used to, but we will break
it down! 

Section headers are defined with hashtags (#), where one # is the largest
header, two ## is the second largest and so on.

You can make words boldface with two ** or two __ (like **so** or __so__). 

You can make words italicized with one * or one _ (like *so* or _so_). 

You can make lists like so:  

- item 1
- item 2
- item 3

<!-- This is an RMarkdown comment. It WILL NOT show in your knitted document. -->

<!-- Comments are great ways to leave yourself notes inside your RMarkdown
document that no one can see!  -->


## R Code 

You can differentiate the R code within an RMarkdown file from the body of 
the document, from the three tickmarks (```) they start and end with. 

Here is an example of an R code chunk:

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
## This is an R comment. R knows this IS NOT code because it has a # in front! 

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
## Code to set the default for whether to output the code from a code chunk

library(tidyverse)
## Code to load in package we need

```

Notice that after the ``` you see a curly brace with an "r" in it ({r}), this 
indicates to RMarkdown that the code inside of that code chunk is R code (not 
Python code or another type of code). 

Also, the "setup" after the "r" is the code chunk's name. It is good practice 
to name your code chunks based on the action they perform. It makes it easier 
to navigate to them in the navigation pane. 


## Knitting 

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes
both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the
document. 

__Question 1: Why do you not see the above code chunk (named setup) when you knit the document?__ 



## Including Code Output

You can include code output in your knitted document: 

```{r cars}
glimpse(mpg)
```

__Question 2: What do you think the above code does? What output does it give you?__



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots in the knitted document. 

Here is an example of a plot. 

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(y = manufacturer, x = hwy)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Highway Miles Per Gallon", 
       y = "Car Manufacturer")
```

__Question 3: What do you think the `echo = FALSE` option does in the above code chunk?__



### Loading Data into `R` 

* Throughout the semester we will use the package `tidyverse` to allow us to use chaining (see Section 1.7 in the textbook for more on this symbol `%>%`.)  Contained in `tidyverse` is the package `ggplot2`, used to create graphs in RStudio.
* We will use the package `infer`, starting in Chapter 5 (and in this activity), to create simulations for statistical inference.  

These packages are already installed in the RStudio server, but you need to use the `library()` function to call the package into your R environment. We will only use the package `tidyverse` for this activity.

### Creating Another Simulation

```{r}
# infer pipeline simulation
# enter in numbers for the sze of the class and the number of reps
```

__Question 4: Is the distribution created from this code similar to what you saw in class in Q14?__
