# Welcoming Classroom

I value diversity, inclusion and equity in this (and every) class. I hold the
fundamental belief that everyone is fully capable of learning and doing 
statistics. There is more than one way to address a statistical 
problem, and our learning will be richer by being open to different ideas,
rejecting stereotypes, and being aware of---in order to minimize---our biases.
I look forward to getting to know you all as individuals and as a learning
community.

# Course description

Stat 218 is designed to engage you in the statistical investigation process
from developing a research question and data collection methods to analyzing and communicating results. This course introduces basic descriptive and inferential
statistics using both traditional (normal and $t$-distribution) and simulation
approaches including confidence intervals and hypothesis testing on means
(one-sample, two-sample, paired), proportions (one-sample, two-sample),
regression and correlation. You will be exposed to numerous examples of
real-world applications of statistics that are designed to help you develop a
conceptual understanding of statistics. 

After taking this course, you will be able to:

- Understand and appreciate how statistics affects your daily life and the
fundamental role of statistics in all disciplines.
- Evaluate statistics and statistical studies you encounter in your other
courses.
- Critically read news stories based on statistical studies as an informed
consumer of data.
- Assess the role of randomness and variability in different contexts.
- Use basic methods to conduct and analyze statistical studies using statistical
software.
- Evaluate and communicate answers to the four pillars of statistical inference:
How strong is the evidence of an effect? What is the size of the effect? How
broadly do the conclusions apply? Can we say what caused the observed
difference?

<!-- ### Cal Poly STAT 218 learning outcomes -->

<!-- 1. Use fundamental principles and techniques from statistics to determine -->
<!-- probabilities of events, interpret summary statistics and to carry out -->
<!-- statistical inferential procedures on real world data sets collected from a -->
<!-- variety of disciplines. -->


<!-- 2. Students will describe how variability arises indata collection, as well as -->
<!-- how sampling variability and sample size affect conclusions made from -->
<!-- statistical hypothesis tests and confidence intervals when these techniques are -->
<!-- used to answer research questions aboutthe world. -->


<!-- 3. Students will describe data collection plans and apply statistical  -->
<!-- inferential procedures, such as hypothesis tests and confidence intervals, to -->
<!-- answer research questions posed in other disciplines, as well as daily life.  -->

<!-- 4. Students will use appropriate statistical language to describe statistical -->
<!-- studies, as well as interpret data analysis results including summary statistics -->
<!-- and probabilities. -->

<!-- 5. Students will describe the biases present in different data collection plans, -->
<!-- as well as the type and limits on scope of conclusions in statistical -->
<!-- investigations. -->

<!-- 6. Students will write clear and logical descriptions of data collection plans, -->
<!-- as well as solutions for statistical inferential procedures in order to provide -->
<!-- quantitative justification for decision-making in a variety of disciplines. -->


### GE: Mathematics / Quantitative Reasoning

This course fulfills the B4: Mathematics / Quantitative Reasoning requirement of 
the General Education curriculum because learning probability and statistics
allows us to disentangle what's really happening in nature from “noise” inherent
in data collection. STAT 218 builds critical thinking skills which form the
basis of statistical inference, allowing students to evaluate claims from data. 

After completing an Area B4 course, students should be able to:

* Calculate and interpret various descriptive statistics

* Identify and describe data collection methods based on simple random sampling
or simple experimental designs

* Construct confidence intervals for a single mean, differences between means
for independent and paired samples, a single proportion, and the difference
between two proportions from independent samples, and interpret the results in
the context of the life sciences

* Formulate various decision problems in the life sciences in terms of
hypothesis tests.

* Calculate parametric hypothesis tests for the difference in two independent
sample means and two independent sample proportions, Chi-square goodness-of-fit,
Chi-square test for independence, and interpret the results in the context of
the life sciences.

* Calculate and interpret non-parametric hypothesis test for two independent
sample means.

* Describe relationships between two quantitative variables using simple linear
regression.

# Course Format & Organization
 
### Communication 

Every Sunday evening there will be an announcement on Canvas letting you know
what is due over the next week, and the material we will be covering. The module 
for each week will be released on Sunday by noon, so you can look over the 
content and see what the plan is for the week. 

We will use Canvas to manage questions and responses regarding course content. 
There are discussion forums for the different components of each week (e.g., 
Week 1 Lab Assignment). Please __do not__ send an email about homework questions
or questions about the course material. It is incredibly helpful for others in
the course to see the questions you have and the responses to those questions.
I will try to answer any questions posted to Canvas within 3-4 hours (unless 
it is posted at midnight). If you think you can answer another student’s
question, please respond! 

Generally, I will work **either** Saturday or Sunday each weekend, and will work 
from approximately 6am to 4pm during the week. I will attempt to respond
to emails in 24 hours, but emails sent on a Saturday night may not be responded
to until Monday morning. If you don't hear back from me in 48 hours, assume I
did not receive your email and resend it!

### Weekly Layout
 
Each week in STAT 218 will, for the most part, look something like this:

```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics('course images/during_week.jpg')

#knitr::include_graphics('course images/weekend.jpg')

```

### Reading & Videos (5%)

You will be expected to complete the assigned textbook reading and course videos
prior to attending the in-class activity for each week. As you complete the 
reading and watch the videos, you should complete the concept check quiz
questions. You can retake the video quizzes as many times as you like (the most
recent grade will be recorded in Canvas) until the deadline.

* Concept check quizzes are due **Monday at 8pm Pacific Time each week**.
* The two lowest concept check quiz grades will be dropped.

### Activities (10%)

Monday's and Tuesday's classes will be dedicated to meeting with your
classmates and instructor to work through that week's group activity. Attendance
and completion of the activity counts towards this portion of your grade. 

* Printed activities will be provided for you on Monday, with Word and PDF 
files posted on Canvas

* Activities will be checked for completion at the **beginning of class on 
Wednesday.** 

* If you have an excused absence the day the activity is due (e.g., quarantine
or ill), you may email Dr. Theobold a scanned copy of the completed activity for
credit. This must be received by **8pm Pacific Time on the day the activity
would be checked in class**.

* The lowest activity grade will be dropped.

### Labs (10%)

Every Wednesday, you will meet with your classmates and instructor to work
through that week's Rstudio Cloud group lab.  The lab will reinforce the ideas
learned in the activities completed Monday and Tuesday, through the use of R to
explore and analyze data.  

* Each group will turn in selected questions from the lab to Canvas. Labs are
due **Friday at 8pm Pacific Time each week**.
* The lowest lab grade will be dropped.
* Each student will also turn in the entirety of each lab for completion at the
**beginning of class on Monday**.

### Assignments (15%)

You will complete weekly assignments in **Canvas**. These should be completed
**individually** (meaning all answers should be written in your own words), but
you may use your classmates, tutors, or your instructor for assistance. 

* Weekly assignments are due **Sunday at 8pm Pacific Time each week**.
* The lowest assignment grade will be dropped.

### Midterm & Final Projects (25%)

There will be two projects throughout the quarter, where you will be asked to 
apply the statistical concepts you have learned in the context of real data. 
Each of these projects will be done in the teams you have been working with in 
class. More details will be provided during class.

### Midterm exams (20%)

There will be one midterm exam (worth 15% of the course grade). The midterm
exam will be taken in class during your normal in-class time. Each exam has a
group (Wednesday) and individual (Friday) component.  A practice exam will be
released in Canvas two weeks prior to the exam, with solutions to the practice
exam released in Canvas one week prior to the exam. Further details, resources,

# Working in Teams 

Working in teams is beneficial for *every* student, but only if each person
meaningfully engages in the discussions being had. Each of you will work in a
group of 2-3 students to discuss the course concepts and complete the course
activities and labs. 

To ensure the group's work is divided equitably each week, your team will be
rotating through a set of group roles. This ensures one person doesn't act as
the group leader for multiple sessions of class, while someone else is always 
the note taker. You will circulate through the following roles each week: 


|  Role         | Responsibilities | 
|---------------|------------------|
| Manager | Responsible for organizing the team work: making sure all roles were assigned and clear, leading discussion of the activity or lab assignment problems. |
| Recorder | Responsible for collecting, organizing, and recording answers to the assignment during the discussions, compiling the summary of the answers discussed, sending summary to Editor. |
| Editor | During the group discussions the editor is responsible for making sure everyone has a chance to contribute, asking quiet team members to speak up, asking loud team members to listen to others, and bringing the conversation back to the lab assignment if it deviates. The Editor is also responsible for reviewing the draft summary provided by the Recorder, sharing the summary with the team, soliciting feedback from the team, and submitting the final assignment by the deadline.|

If you are in a group of two, the *Manager* also acts as the Editor*, and is 
expected to both organize the team work, lead the discussion, and review the
draft summary prepared by the Recorder.

## Team Meetings

There will be time in each class for your team to work on the assignment for 
the week, however this time will not be sufficient to complete the assignments.
Therefore, every group is expected to meet for at least 1-hour outside of
class. 

__If you are not in attendance for *more than one* of your team meetings that 
week, you will be expected to complete that week's assignment on your own.__ 

My hope is that each member of the group looks over the week's assignment on
Monday while reading the week's chapter(s). Then, each member should have a 
solid understanding of the content by Tuesday's activity. During Tuesday's
activity and Wednesday's lab, the Team Manager is tasked with leading the
discussion of the activity. The Reporter is tasked with recording the ideas 
shared by the team. The editor is tasked with ensuring each team member has 
the opportunity to share and, following the class meeting, is in charge of
reviewing the draft submitted by the Recorder. 

As a team, you can choose to work together or independently on the assignment's 
problems between course meetings. The Manager is responsible for scheduling
additional meetings, so that the Editor is able to submit the assignment on
time. 

---

## Behavioral Expectations 

This course will use group work and classroom activities to better engage your
understanding of the material. The environment for these discussions and
activities is expected to adhere to ground rules, so that we create an open
space where everyone feels welcome and supported, and comfortable with voicing 
their opinion. 

By participating in this community, students accept to abide by the classroom 
Code of Conduct and accept the procedures by which any Code of Conduct incidents
are resolved. Any form of behavior to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort
is a violation of the Code of Conduct. In order to foster a positive
and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of
behaviors in all platforms and events:

- use welcoming and inclusive language
- everyone participates and no one dominates
- listen to understand
- share airtime
- one speaker at a time
- disagree with respect
- be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- all ideas are valid
- gracefully accept constructive criticism
- treat everything you hear as an opportunity to learn and grow
- seek common ground and understanding

---

# Late Work Policy 

Assignments  are expected to be submitted on time. However, every
student will be permitted to submit **one** individual assignment 24 hours late
without question. You do not need to contact me to use this allowance, but if
you find yourself in a position where you have used this allowance and you 
cannot complete another assignment by the due date, __you are expected to email me__. Once you email me, we can work together to find a deadline that is fair 
to both you and other students. If I do not hear from you, I will take a 5% reduction in score for every day an assignment is late, up to four days

You are also expected to participate in the week's team collaborations in a
timely manner. I will be able to monitor your involvement through your course 
attendance. If you find that you are unable to participate in the week's team
collaborations, __please let your team know and contact me__.
Once you contact me, we can create a timeline that will both allow for you to
engage in the assignment and allow for members of your team to receive
feedback from you. 

If you need to miss a class due to illness, quarantine, or other extenuating
circumstances, please email Dr. Theobold and group-mates letting them know
**prior to the class meeting**.  You may participate in the lab or activity via
video conferencing if desired or you may complete the lab on your own.  If
needed, I will determine an appropriate extension on the lab based on your
individual circumstances.

**Exams**: 

- Students that are in quarantine but healthy enough to take the exam should
email Dr. Theobold to arrange to take the exam at home while being proctored
via Zoom.

- If you are ill to the point of not being able to take the exam, please email
Dr. Theobold to arrange a time to take the exam remotely via Zoom when you are
feeling better within the week of the exam.

- Students who miss the exam without contacting the Dr. Theobold prior to the
exam will receive a zero on the exam.

- Work is not a legitimate reason for an exam absence.

#### COVID-19 Addendum

I understand and appreciate the strange world we find ourselves living in today. 
Surrounded by a variety of factors, many of us find ourselves overwhelmed, 
frustrated, confused, and sad. I appreciate all of these outside forces you are
navigating, and will do my best to monitor the pace of our course so that no one
feels left behind. Yes, this may mean that we may not hit every learning
outcome. Instead, it is of utmost importance to me that you leave this course
with an appreciation for the entire statistical investigation process
from developing a research question and data collection methods to analyzing and communicating results, and that you participate in group conversations about
statistical reasoning and problem solving.

# Policy on academic misconduct

Students in an academic setting are responsible for approaching all assignments
with rigor, integrity, and in compliance with the University Code of Student
Conduct. Students	are	expected to	be good citizens and to	engage in responsible
behaviors that reflect well	upon their university, to	be civil to	one	another
and	to others	in	the	campus community,	and	contribute positively	to student
and	university life.	

It is expected that students adhere to the following responsibilities: 

1. consult and analyze sources that are relevant to the topic of inquiry;

2. acknowledge when they draw from the ideas or the phrasing of those sources
in their own writing;

3. learn and use appropriate citation conventions within the field in which they
are studying; and

4. ask their instructor for guidance when they are uncertain of how to
acknowledge the contributions of others in their thinking and writing.

When students fail to adhere to these responsibilities, they may intentionally
or unintentionally "use someone else’s language, ideas, or other original (not
common-knowledge) material without properly acknowledging its source" [http://www.wpacouncil.org](http://www.wpacouncil.org). When the act is
intentional, the student has engaged in plagiarism.

Plagiarism is an act of academic misconduct, which carries with it consequences
including, but not limited to, receiving a course grade of “F” and a report to
the Office of the Dean of Students. Unfortunately, it is not always clear if the
misuse of sources is intentional or unintentional, which means that you may be
accused of plagiarism even if you do not intentionally plagiarize. If you have
any questions regarding use and citation of sources in your academic writing,
you are responsible for consulting with your instructor before the assignment
due date. In addition, you can work with an Writing Center tutor at any point
in your writing process, including when you are integrating or citing sources.

**In STAT 218, students involved in plagiarism on assignments (all parties involved) will receive a zero grade on that assignment. The second offense will result in a zero on that assignment, and the incident will be reported to the Office of Students Rights and Responsibilities. Academic misconduct on an exam will result in a zero on that exam and will be reported to the Dean of Students, without exception.**
