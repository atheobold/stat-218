### Learning outcomes

* Identify and create appropriate summary statistics and plots given a data set
or research question for data.

* Interpret the following summary statistics in context: median, lower quartile,
upper quartile, standard deviation, interquartile range.

* Given a plot or set of plots, describe and compare the distribution(s) of a
single quantitative variable (center, variability, shape, outliers).
  
* Use `R` to create graphs of variables.

### The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS)

**Bolded questions will be answered on Canvas for your group.**

These data are on a subset of institutions that met the following selection
criteria:

*	Degree granting 

* United States only

* Title IV participating

* Not for profit

* 2-year or 4-year or above

* Has full-time first-time undergraduates

*Note:* Several variables have missing values for some institutions (denoted
by “NA”).

### Loading in the Data

```{r data, include = FALSE}

IPEDS <- read_csv(here::here("Week 2 - Viz & Summarize Quantitative Variables", 
                             "lab", 
                             "data", 
                             "IPEDS_Data_2018.csv")
                  )

IPEDS <- read_csv(here::here("data", 
                             "IPEDS_Data_2018.csv")
                  )
```


For our analysis, we will look at the retention rates for *only* the 4-year
institutions. In the code below I'm filtering the dataset down to ony include
4-year institutions (eliminating 2-year institutions). 

```{r data-filter}

IPEDS_fouryear <- IPEDS %>%
  filter(Sector != "Public 2-year", 
         Sector != "Private 2-year"
         ) 
```

### Summarizing Retention Rates

There is a great function from the **mosaic** package called `favstats()`. This
function takes one or two variables and outputs the favorite statistics we are
interested in! 

The notation for the function is: 

favstats(variable1 ~ variable2, data = dataset_name)

In this case we are only interested in *one* variable, so we leave out
variable1. But! We need to keep the ~ in the notation. So, the code looks like
the following:

```{r summarize}
favstats(~ Retention, data = IPEDS_fouryear) 
```


3.  **Report the value for third quartile and interpret this value in context of the study.**

4.  **What is the interquartile range of the retention rates?**
<!-- Your answer goes below this comment! -->



5. Report and interpret the value of the standard deviation.
<!-- Your answer goes below this comment! -->



6.  **How many missing values are there? Is this concerning?**
<!-- Your answer goes below this comment! -->



### Visualizing Retention Rates

#### Creating a Boxplot 

We will start by creating a boxplot of the retention rates for the 4-year
institutions. You will get used to seeing the layout of the ggplot() code we
will use to make visualizations, but since this is the first time you are seeing
it I'm going to walk you through what the parts mean. 

The first line of code uses the ggplot() function to make a blank plot. Really, 
the plot doesn't have anything on it! What the function does is (1) specify 
where the data is coming from, and (2) specify what variables should be put
where. 

The next line tells ggplot() what to put on the blank plot. We get a boxplot
by using the geom_boxplot() function, it is as simple as that! 

The final line of code creates nicer axis labels. The default axis labels use 
the name of the variables in the dataset, which sometimes aren't quite what
we want. Using the labs() function, we can specify what labels we want on our 
plot. 

7. Fill in the code below with (1) the name of the variable you want to plot,
and (2) a nice x-axis label to use. 

```{r boxplot}
ggplot(data = IPEDS, 
       mapping = aes(x = ____)
       ) +   
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(x = "_____") 
```

7.  How would you describe the shape of the distribution of retention rates?  
<!-- Your answer goes below this comment! -->



8.  Are there outliers present in the dataset? Describe where these outliers are
located. 
<!-- Your answer goes below this comment! -->



#### Creating a Histogram

Next, let's see how our impression of the distribution changes when we 
visualize it with a histogram. 

The code for a histogram is **very** similar to a boxplot. Really, all we need
to change is the line saying to plot a boxplot: geom_boxplot(). For a 
histogram, we use geom_histogram(). 

Fill in the code below with (1) the name of the variable you want to plot, and
(2) a nice x-axis label to use. 

```{r histogram}
ggplot(data = IPEDS, 
       mapping = aes(x = ____)
       ) +   
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) + 
  labs(x = "_____", 
       y = "Frequency") 
```


#### Robust Statistics

Let's examine how the presence of outliers affect the values of center and
spread. 

9.  **Report the two measures of center for retention given in the previous output from the favstats() function).**
<!-- Your answer goes below this comment! -->


10.  **Report the two measures of spread for retention given in the previous output (from the favstats() function).**
<!-- Your answer goes below this comment! -->


To show the effect of outliers on the measures of center and spread, in the 
code below, I increase the smallest values of retention rate in the data by 30%.
Highlight and run lines 30--38.  

```{r data-adjust}
IPEDS_fouryear_adj <- IPEDS_fouryear %>% 
  mutate(Retention = 
           if_else(Retention == 0, -30, Retention), 
         Retention = as.numeric(Retention)
         )
```

```{r new-summaries}
favstats(~ ____, data = IPEDS_fouryear_adj) 
```

11. **Report the two measures of center for these modified retention rates.**



12. **Report the two measures of spread for these modified retention rates.**



13. **Which measure of center is robust to outliers? Explain your answer.**



14.  Which measure of spread is robust to outliers?  Explain your answer.
