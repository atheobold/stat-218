## Part One: American Indian Address

For this activity, you will read a speech given by Jim Becenti, a member of the
Navajo American Indian tribe, who spoke about the employment problems his people
faced at an Office of Indian Affairs meeting in Phoenix, Arizona, on January 30,
1947. His speech is below:

***It is hard for us to go outside the reservation where we meet strangers. I
have been off the reservation ever since I was sixteen. Today I am sorry I quit
the Santa Fe [Railroad]. I worked for them in 1912-13. You are enjoying life,
liberty, and happiness on the soil the American Indian had, so it is your
responsibility to give us a hand, brother. Take us out of distress. I have never
been to vocational school. I have very little education. I look at the white man
who is a skilled laborer. When I was a young man I worked for a man in Gallup as
a carpenter’s helper. He treated me as his own brother. I used his tools. Then
he took his tools and gave me a list of tools I should buy and I started
carpentering just from what I had seen. We have no alphabetical language.***

***We see things with our eyes and can always remember it. I urge that we help my
people to progress in skilled labor as well as common labor. The hope of my
people is to change our ways and means in certain directions, so they can help
you someday as taxpayers. If not, as you are going now, you will be burdened the
rest of your life. The hope of my people is that you will continue to help so
that we will be all over the United States and have a hand with you, and give us
a brotherly hand so we will be happy as you are. Our reservation is awful small.
We did not know the capacity of the range until the white man come and say “you
raise too much sheep, got to go somewhere else,” resulting in reduction to a
skeleton where the Indians can’t make a living on it. For eighty years we have
been confused by the general public, and what is the condition of the Navajo
today? Starvation! We are starving for education. Education is the main thing
and the only thing that is going to make us able to compete with you great men
here talking to us.***

### By eye selection

5. Circle ten words in Jim Becenti's speech which are a representative sample of
the length of words in the entire text.  Describe your method for selecting this
sample.

</br>
</br>
</br>

6. Fill in the table below with your selected words from the previous question
and the length of each word (number of letters/digits in the word):

</br>

```{r, fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/word_length.png")
```

</br>

7.  Calculate the mean word length in your selected sample.  Is this value a parameter or a statistic?   

</br>
</br>

8.  Report your mean word length to Dr. Theobold to create a visualization of
the distribution of results generated by the class. Draw a picture of the plot
here. Be sure to include a descriptive $x$-axis label!

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>


9. Based on the plot of sample mean word lengths in question 8, what is your
best guess for the average word length of the population of all 359 words in
the speech? 

</br>
</br>

10. The true mean word length of the population of all 359 words in the speech
is 3.95 letters. Is this value a parameter or a statistic?   

</br>
</br>

11. Where does the value of 3.95 fall in the plot above?

</br>
</br>

12. If your samples were truly representative, what proportion of sample means
would you expect to be below 3.95?

</br>
</br>

13.  What proportion of students' computed sample means were lower than the true mean of 3.95 letters? 

</br>
</br>

14.  Based on your answers to questions 11 and 12, would you say the sampling method used by the class is biased or unbiased?  Justify your answer.

</br>
</br>
</br>

15.  If the sampling method is biased, what type of bias is present?  What is
the direction of the bias, i.e., does the method tend to overestimate or
underestimate the population mean word length?

</br>
</br>
</br>

16.  Should we use results from our by eye samples to make a statement about the
word length in the population of words in Becenti's address?  Why or why not?

</br>
</br>
</br>

## Part Two: Random selection

Suppose instead of attempting to select a representative sample by eye (which
did not work), each student used a random number generator to select a simple
random sample of 10 words. A **simple random sample** relies on a random
mechanism to choose a sample, without replacement, from the population, such
that every sample of size 10 is equally likely to be chosen.

To use a random number generator to select a simple random sample, you first
need a numbered list of all the words in the population, called a **sampling
frame**. You can then generate 10 random numbers from the numbers 1 to 359 (the
number of words in the population), and the chosen random numbers correspond to
the chosen words in your sample.

1. Use the random number generator at 
<https://istats.shinyapps.io/RandomNumbers/> to select a simple random sample
from the population of all 359 words in the speech. 

* Set "Choose Minimum" to 1 and "Choose Maximum" to 359 to represent the 359
words in the population (the sampling frame).

* Set "How many numbers do you want to generate?" to 10 and ensure the "No"
option is selected under "Sample with Replacement?" 

Fill in the table below with the random numbers selected and use the Becenti.csv data file found on Canvas to determine each number’s corresponding word and word
length (number of letters / digits in the word):

</br>

```{r, fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/random_word_length.png")
```

</br>

2. Calculate the mean word length in your selected sample in question 1. Is this
value a parameter or a statistic?


</br>
</br>

3. Report your mean word length to your instructor.  Your instructor will guide the class in creating a visualization of the distribution of results generated by your class. Draw a picture of the plot here. Include a descriptive $x$-axis label.
\vspace{1.7in}

4.  Where does the value 3.95, the true mean word length, fall in the distribution created in question 4?


5. How does the plot generated in question 4 compare to the plot generated in question 8 from Activity 2a? 

- Which features are similar?  

</br>

- Which features differ? 

</br>

-Why didn’t everyone get the same sample mean?

</br>
</br>

One set of randomly generated sample mean word lengths from a single class may
not be large enough to visualize the distribution results. Let’s have a computer
generate 1,000 sample mean word lengths for us.

*  Navigate to the “One Variable with Sampling” Rossman/Chance web applet: http://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/2021/sampling/OneSample.html?population=gettysburg.

*  Click "Clear" below the text box containing data from the Gettysburg address
to delete that data set.

*  Download the Becenti.csv file from Canvas and open the spreadsheet on your
computer.

*  Copy and paste the population of word lengths (column C) into the applet from
the data set provided making sure to include the header.  Click "Use Data". 
Verify that the mean for the data set is 3.953 with a sample size of 359.  If
these are not the values you got, check with Dr. Theobold for help with copying
in the data set correctly.

*  Click the check-box for "Show Sampling Options"

*  Select 1000 for "Number of samples" and select 10 for the "Sample size".  

*  Click “Draw Sample(s)”.

6. The plot labeled “Statistic” displays the 1,000 randomly generated sample
mean word lengths. Sketch this plot below. Include a descriptive $x$-axis label
and be sure to write down the provided mean and SD (standard deviation) of the
distribution.

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

7. What is the center value of the distribution created in question 7?

</br>
</br>

8. Explain why the sampling method of using a random number generator to
generate a sample is a "better" method than choosing 10 words “by eye”.

</br>
</br>
</br>


9.  Is random selection an unbiased method of selection?  Explain your answer.
Be sure to reference your plot from question 6!

</br>
</br>
</br>

### Effect of sample size

We will now consider the impact of sample size.

10. First, consider if each student had selected 20 words, instead of 10, by
eye. Do you think this would make the plot from question 8 in Part One centered
on 3.95 (the true mean word length)?  Explain your answer.

</br>
</br>
</br>


11. Now we will select 20 words instead of 10 words at random.

*  In the "One Variable with Sampling” Rossman/Chance web applet <http://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/2021/sampling/OneSample.html?population=gettysburg>, change the Sample size to 20.

*  Click “Draw Sample(s)”.

The plot labeled “Statistic” displays the 1,000 randomly generated sample 
word lengths. Sketch this plot below.  Include a descriptive $x$-axis label and
be sure to write down the provided mean and SD (standard deviation) of the
distribution.

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

12.  Compare the distribution created in question 11 to the one created in 
question 6.

- Which features are similar?  

</br>

- Which features differ? 

</br>


13. Compare the spreads of the plots in question 11 and in question 6. You
should see that in one plot all sample means are closer to the population mean
than in the other. Which plot shows this?

</br>
</br>

14. Using the evidence from your simulations, answer the following research questions.

- Does changing the sample size impact whether the sample estimates are
unbiased? Explain your answer.

</br>
</br>

- Does changing the sample size impact the variability of sample estimates?
Explain your answer

</br>
</br>
</br>

15.  What is the purpose of random selection of a sample from the population? 

</br>
</br>
</br>

## Take-home messages

1.	Random selection is an unbiased method of selection.

2.	When we use a biased method of selection, we will over or underestimate the parameter.

3. To see if a method is biased, we compare the distribution of the estimates to
the true value. We want our estimate to be on target or unbiased.  When using
unbiased methods of selection, the mean of the distribution matches our true
parameter.

4. If the sampling method is biased, inferences made about the population based
on a sample estimate will not be valid. 

5. Random selection eliminates selection bias.  Random selection will not eliminate response or non-response bias however.

6. The larger the sample size, the more similar (less variable) the statistics
will be from different samples.  

7. Sample size has no impact on whether a *sampling method* is biased or not.
Taking a larger sample using a biased method will still result in a sample that
is not representative of the population.
