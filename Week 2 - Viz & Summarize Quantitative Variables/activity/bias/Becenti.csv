it
is 
hard
for
us
to
go
outside
the
reservation
where
we
meet
strangers
I
I
have
been
off
the
reservation
since
I
was
sixteen
Today
I
am
sorry
I
quit
the
Santa
Fe
I
worked
for
them
in
1912-13
You
are
enjoying
life
liberty
and
happiness
on
the
soil
the
American
Indian
has
so
it
is 
your
responsibility
to
give
us
a
hand
brother
Take
us
outside
of 
distress
I
have
never
been
to
vocational
school
I
have
very
little
education
I
look
at
the
white
man
who
is 
a
skilled
laborer
When
I
was
a
young
man
I
worked
for
a
man
in
Gallup
as
a
carpenter's
helper
helper
treated
me
as
his
own
brother
I
used
his
tools
Then
he
took
his
tools
and
gave
me
a
list
of
tools
I
should
buy
and 
I
started
carpentering
just
from
what
I
had
seen
We
have
no
alphabetical
lanuguage
We
seen
things
with
our
eyes
and
can
always
remember
it
I
urge
that
we
help
my
people
to
progress
in
skilled
labor
as
well
as
common
labor
The
hope
of
my
people
is 
to
change
our
ways
and
means
in
certain
directions
so
they
can
help
you
someday
as
taxpayers
If
not
as
you
are
going
now
you
will
be
burdened
the
rest
of
your
life
The
hope
of
my
people
is 
that
you
will
continue
to
help
so
that
we
will
be
all
over
the
United
States
and
have
a
hand
with
you
and
give
us
a
brotherly
hand
so
we
will
be
happy
as
you
are
Our
reservation
is 
awful
small
We
did
not
know
the
capacity
of
the
range
until
the
white
man
come
and 
say
you 
raise
too
much
sheep
got
to
go
somewhere
else
resulting
in
reduction
to
a
skeleton
where
the
Indians
can't
make
a
living
on
it
For
eighty
years
we
have
been
confused
by 
the
general
public
and
what
is
the
condition
of 
the
Navajo
today
Starvation
We
are
starving
for
education
Education
is
the
main
thing
and
the
only
thing
that
is
going
to
make
us
able
to
compete
with
you
great
men
here
talking
to
us
