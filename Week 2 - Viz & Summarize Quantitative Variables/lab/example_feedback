Yes! The median is a robust measure of center, since it doesn't move much if
outliers are included in the data. The mean, however, is pulled in the direction
of the outliers. 

You are on the right track! The IQR depends on percentiles, the 25% and 75%, 
which are similar to the median. These percentiles don't move much if outliers
are included in the data. The standard deviation, however, depends on the mean
as its measure of center, so it is definitely not robust!
